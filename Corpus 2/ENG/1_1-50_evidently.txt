But under depression conditions -- which is what we have now -- inflation is very much a positive thing.Here's a quick example from Eichengreen and Sachs showing changes in the gold value of currencies 1929-35 versus changes in industrial production; the devaluation of currencies against gold was closely related to the changes in their overall price level:Yep, countries were able to inflate their way to prosperity.

So now analysts are asking the same question about 2003. And this time even auto executives are bracing for a slump.   "Consumers are evidently responding to a sluggish economy," said Scott Sprinzen, a credit analyst for Standard & Poor's, in a recent report that suggested that a slump evident in recent months would be likely to continue into next year. "After a string of exceptionally good sales years, the market is evidently saturated." Last year, the terrorist attacks emptied car lots of potential buyers until General Motors refilled them quickly with its "Keep America Rolling" advertising and incentive campaign, which included offers of interest-free financing. The Ford Motor Company and the Chrysler Group, a unit of DaimlerChrysler, quickly followed suit, and the ensuing price war made October 2001 the best month in industry history. By the end of last year, analysts worried that buoyant sales could not possibly continue in balky economic conditions and with spending money drained in a bear market. But they did. For much of the year, the Big Three price war kept people buying, providing a spot of hopefulness in a doleful economy. At least until October, the industry's worst month in more than four years. Though sales recovered somewhat in November, they were still off 13 percent from the robust levels of November 2001. Is this a hiccup or a harbinger? There is hardly a consensus. On the bullish side is Scott Hill, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein & Company, who predicts industry sales of 16.7 million vehicles next year, compared with the 16.5 million to 16.8 million expected for 2002. Mr. Hill cites a combination of factors, from an economy that he believes is stabilizing to consumers' desire to swap cars more often because of a glut of new products and new features, coupled with low prices. Demographic trends are also favorable, he says, because two big generations -- baby boomers and their children, Generation Y -- are entering crucial car-buying years. "Peak buying is around age 47," Mr. Hill said. "That's the absolute peak of automotive consumption. The percentage of the population moving into that area continues to rocket."Members of Generation Y, he added, are moving into a period of heavy used-car buying and are also probably buying more new vehicles because of cheap offerings from Hyundai and its Kia brand. Other analysts, like Ronald A. Tadross of Banc of America Securities, are pessimistic. Mr. Tadross says sales are likely to be no higher than 16 million and possibly as low as 14 million next year, the latter number being something of a doomsday prediction considering that sales peaked in the United States at 17.4 million in 2000 and were 17.1 million in 2001. Mr. Tadross predicts that a dropoff in leasing in recent years will mean that 500,000 to a million fewer cars will come off leases next year -- and thus will not need replacing. He also says booming sales of recent years have left many people with young cars that work fine and are not worth trading in because resale values are depressed by a flood of new and used cars. "We already are hearing reports from dealers of trade-in-value shock on the part of consumers," he wrote in a recent report.Whatever the level of sales diminishment, most agree it will come largely from the hide of the Big Three, which have been losing market share to foreign brands for years. Top foreign brands have managed to outsell Detroit despite having far lower incentive offers. In October, for instance, Honda's sales fell 5.6 percent, far better than the industry at large, even though the company's incentive costs, be they rebates or reduced financing, amounted to only $416 a vehicle, according to the Autodata Corporation.By comparison, sales fell 32 percent at G.M. and 34 percent at Ford despite incentive spending of $2,575 and $2,392 a vehicle, respectively. These levels could be pushed higher if demand diminishes because competition is only increasing as foreign automakers like Nissan, Toyota and Honda continue to build more plants and push more vehicles in the United States, by far the most lucrative market.And these are only the beginning of the Big Three's headaches next year. "Pension expenses will be higher," said John A. Casesa, an auto analyst at Merrill Lynch, "some raw-materials costs will be higher, like steel, and we'll probably see an increase in wage and benefit costs," because a new contract will be negotiated with the United Auto Workers. "Even before the sales outlook, things will be tough," he said.URL: http://www.nytimes.com LOAD-DATE: December 16, 2002  LANGUAGE: ENGLISH GRAPHIC: Photo: Nissans lined up in Port Elizabeth, N.J.

In the simple intensity of Logan's disgust at the poet's life and work -- a disgust which is at once aesthetic, moral and sexual -- we see Crane's evidently enduring capacity to affront conventional tastes, and a little bit of his permanent power and value.Langdon HammerNew HavenTo the Editor:   Evidently, William Logan has run out of living poets to eviscerate. In this era of conflict, when America can use all the good poetry it can find, it's dispiriting to encounter a reviewer who uses one of our most important reviewing venues to exercise an organ of bile.  When the Library of America takes on as part of its mandate the showcasing of essential American poets like Hart Crane, we look to our reviewers to address the importance of the poet's writing, not his lifestyle. Yet Logan's review of the collected poems and letters mentions but two poems (dismissively) and quotes a scant 18 lines of poetry, despite the luxury of two pages allotted to poetry, rare for the Book Review. And he quotes only what he finds irritating, providing a choice few lines from ''Chaplinesque,'' which he considers a ''dreadful mess,'' while disingenuously ignoring the memorable ending of that poem, which reads:   ... but we have seen  The moon in lonely  alleys make  A grail of laughter of  an empty ash can,  And through all sound  of gaiety and quest  Have heard a kitten  in the wilderness.  And there is no mention of such important Crane poems as ''Repose of Rivers,'' ''At Melville's Tomb,'' ''The Broken Tower,'' ''My Grandmother's Love Letters,'' ''For the Marriage of Faustus and Helen'' or most surprisingly, Crane's beautifully evocative poem ''Voyages.''   Elsewhere, Logan tells us that '' 'The Bridge' is like being stuck in a mawkish medley from 'Show Boat' '' and that the poem ''seems trivial, its ideas torn from the daily paper or the pages of a high school history textbook.'' He tops off this opinion with the clownish wordplay: ''We have no long poems this close to being great that are greater failures.'' Classic damning with faint praise?  Logan believes that ''The Library of America edition ... contains more of Crane than most readers will ever need,'' but he also complains that ''the poems take up so little space.'' Bad enough that he can't make up his mind regarding quantity and greatness, it would appear that his formula for greatness is somehow a function of drinking in moderation, securing employment, not cruising for sex (Logan is not beyond scolding the dead, complaining that Crane was involved with ''far too many sailors'') and writing a lot: ''Crane left only two very short books and the shards of a third.'' I guess that makes Harper Lee, Ralph Ellison, John Kennedy Toole and Malcolm Lowry all failures for their dismal output.  Maybe the problem here is the self-importance the critic accords himself, imagining that ''a hundred American poets will begin odes to Angelina Jolie'' upon reading this review. Who's delusional now? And to compare Jolie to Chaplin causes a wonder of its own.  Call me crazy, or just another poetry publisher, but I have to believe people read reviews to find books to read, even books of poetry. Poetry is what people turn to during times of duress and celebration -- marriage, death, 9/11 -- that is, our rites of passage. Logan's is a review riveted to the underbelly of the biographical, and to the poetry not at all. What is not addressed is the fact that we have here a celebration of an American original, memorialized by one of our most distinguished publishing imprints, the Library of America.  The most surprising part of the review, however, is the fact that Logan has continued to review poetry. I would have thought he'd have followed his instincts long ago and found something more kindred of his soul.Daniel HalpernNew YorkThe writer is the publisher of Ecco Press.URL: http://www.nytimes.comLOAD-DATE: February 11, 2007LANGUAGE: ENGLISHDOCUMENT-TYPE: LetterPUBLICATION-TYPE: NewspaperCopyright 2007 The New York Times Company4 of 50 DOCUMENTS The New York TimesNovember 14, 2001 Wednesday   Late Edition - Final Business Travel; After Monday's crash, CNN Airport Network gave travelers a singing cowboy instead of news.BYLINE:  By Joe Sharkey SECTION: Section C; Column 4; Business/Financial Desk; Pg. 9LENGTH: 806 wordsUSUALLY, those televisions hanging overhead in airport passenger-waiting areas drive me to distraction with their announcers constantly braying about some company's stock price or some windstorm in the Caribbean.     There are times, though, when there is sufficient reason even for an admitted TV-hating crank like me to turn anxiously to the tube in an airport.  Monday morning at Newark International Airport was one of those times. A little before 9:45, I was on board Continental Airlines Flight l011, which was about to depart for Houston, when the pilot came on the loudspeaker. Everybody had to get off the plane, he said, because there had been "an incident" at Kennedy International Airport. Naturally, passengers filing off the plane headed right for the CNN Airport Network television in the waiting area to find out more about this unspecified incident. After all, some of these same people had been stranded for a day or longer at various airports after that earlier "incident" on Sept. 11.We stood blinking at the television in mounting disbelief. On the screen was a man wearing a cowboy hat and a shiny shirt, strumming a guitar and, evidently, singing a song. I say evidently because the sound was off."Do you believe this?" said a man whose one-day business trip to Houston was suddenly starting to look like an overnighter.For just a few minutes, said a woman who had been bound for Miami on business, the television showed live news reports about the crash near J.F.K. "Then the screen went blank and then they put on the CNN logo," she said.And now we all stood, glaring at a singing cowboy as if it were his fault that the television had no news.At the same time, all around the lounge, an interesting thing was occurring. People talking on their cellphones would pause and pass along bits of information to strangers standing nearby. An ad hoc grass-roots news-gathering operation, as modern as the communications satellite and as ancient as the backyard fence, had sprung into operation."An American Airlines 767 crashed into some houses right after takeoff from Kennedy," one man said to a small group of people, giving information that was inaccurate about the plane model but otherwise quite sound."Nobody's going anywhere for a while; J.F.K., La Guardia and Newark are closed," said Greg Vartanian, an off-duty Continental pilot, whose information came by cellphone via a friend watching the news in Boston.CNN Airport Network, a division of AOL Time Warner, was founded in 1992 in response "to passengers' need for immediate information during the Persian Gulf war," according to a statement on the Web site of the network, which claims 18 million viewers a month at major domestic airports.The network broadcasts news and features customized for airport viewers, as well as portions of regular live CNN news and other programs. However, said Edna Johnson, a spokeswoman, there are deliberate policies to shield viewers in airports from live news of plane crashes.Part of the rationale for blocking crash news, she explained, is that people in airports are a "captive audience" lacking "the ability to turn the television off," as they could at home, to avoid seeing frightening images.The network also believes that showing the typically "piecemeal" reporting of airplane crashes soon after they occur is a disservice to those confined in airports, she said. The network usually delays reporting on such events for an hour or two after the incident, and then typically uses its own anchors, who report the story using little or no video.Whatever the airport network does, "the airlines and airport authorities have the right to turn the television off" whenever they choose, she added. "And that did happen at a handful of airports" on Monday, she said.CNN Airport Network said it did not block the news at all on Sept. 11. "Because of the overriding international importance of those events," the network showed the regular CNN News broadcasts live and uncensored for 19 days, Ms. Johnson said.At the Newark airport Monday morning, meanwhile, there were places where the information blackout was total, like the terminal areas near security checkpoints, where rifle-toting National Guard troops in camouflage fatigues ordered people not to use their cellphones.But there were places at the airport where the information flowed freely, like the membership-only Continental Presidents Club. Some frequent fliers there were drinking coffee around a television that was broadcasting the regular live CNN news report.One of those watching, Brian Parman, a Hilton Hotel executive from Memphis, was thus able to provide a full, up-to-date and accurate summary of the crash news as of 10:30."I was in the lounge when I got a call on my cellphone from my mom, who told me I should get to a television fast," he said.URL: http://www.nytimes.com LOAD-DATE: November 14, 2001  LANGUAGE: ENGLISH PUBLICATION-TYPE: NewspaperCopyright 2001 The New York Times Company5 of 50 DOCUMENTS The New York TimesOctober 24, 2003 Friday   Late Edition - Final THEATER REVIEW; Professors With No Flash and Shows With Too Much of ItBYLINE:  By BRUCE WEBER  SECTION: Section E; Part 1; Column 3; Movies, Performing Arts/Weekend Desk; Pg. 4LENGTH: 926 wordsFor many years, as he was forging his reputation as a playwright, A. R. Gurney was also a college professor, and in recent plays like "Human Events" and "The Fourth Wall" he has portrayed campus denizens in not-so-flattering terms. The academic life he depicts is an insular one, the academics themselves self-absorbed and self-important. They behave almost as if they were performing for an audience.      Indeed, more than once Mr. Gurney has used the university setting to make arguments about the state of the theater, which he also finds insular and self-absorbed, increasingly marginalized and increasingly accepting of its marginalization. In "Strictly Academic," an evening of two one-acts directed by Paul Benedict and having its New York premiere Off Broadway at Primary Stages, Mr. Gurney is painting his direst portraits yet of both the campus and the theater.   The opening playlet, "The Problem," is a shrewd, sardonic bit of camp about the sex life of a mathematics professor (Keith Reddin) and his wife (Susan Greenhill). It begins with her tentative interruption of him as he works intently at his desk with a compass and a slide rule, and his noticing, evidently for the first time, that she shows all the signs of a pregnancy about to culminate. In a very funny dialogue, the level of their inability to communicate with each other is ratcheted up again and again as a discussion of "the problem," as they refer to the pregnancy, reveals the kinky predilections that each of them has evidently been hiding from the other. Mr. Reddin and Ms. Greenhill handle the farcical satire with a finely tuned ratio of hyperbole and restraint. In retrospect, there is a hole in the narrative logic -- it can't be explained without giving too much away -- though you can choose to overlook it (and you should) because the rewards of doing so are satisfyingly humorous. The story takes some imaginative swerves, and the twist at the end is just right. It's a slight piece, but deftly handled all around, and it gently makes a savage point about academics who live only in their own minds and not in the world.In the concluding play, "The Guest Lecturer," Mr. Gurney has the same mischief in his heart but bigger things in mind. It takes place in a nonprofit theater, where Mona (Ms. Greenhill), the loopy artistic director, is introducing Hartley Carr (Remy Auberjonois), the young, idealistic scholar who is to speak to an audience of subscribers on the hifalutin topic of drama in America. It's another farce: Mona, who apparently has never had an unexpressedthought, won't let Hartley get started because she can't stop talking mindlessly about herself. And Hartley, it turns out, is another of Mr. Gurney's clueless academics; he has no idea what he's gotten himself into, though we figure it out long before he does. (Hint: Shirley Jackson's short story "The Lottery" comes to mind.) There is something terrifically sly and admirable about Mr. Gurney's idea here, for what he's constructed is an elaborate, plaintive allegory about what he sees as the strangulation of the theater in America. Mainly, of course, it's the forces of commerce that are lamented. (Mr. Reddin plays the greedy chairman of the theater board.) But Mr. Gurney has a lot of blame to pass around for the marginalization of theater art -- even to us, the audiences who are so uneducated and impatient that the only things we'll eagerly watch are spectacle, blood and guts, sex and people willing to humiliate themselves in public. And in his intertwining of slapstick black comedy and essayistic argument on behalf of the theater as a force for good in the world, he achieves something interesting and rare: a passionate cri de coeur delivered with a smile. That it doesn't quite work is too bad. Among other things, the character of Mona, who needs to be perceived as dull, pathetic and unbearable, is all those things. The pace flags, something that the director, Mr. Benedict, doesn't seem to have noticed. And there are several points in the unfolding plot where what's meant as a surprise has been long anticipated. This is at least partly because the particulars of Mr. Gurney's lament about the state of the theater are pretty familiar. But they also feel a little out of date. Admittedly, the theater doesn't haul in the mass audiences it once did. Admittedly, on Broadway, its most prominent site, theater art has taken a back seat to theater entertainment. Admittedly, economics are a reality with which the theater must cope, and admittedly, the tail, on occasion, wags the dog.But any critic will tell you that you can go to the theater nightly and still not come close to keeping up with new work that rarely achieves but often aspires to the level of art. From that perspective, the theater is currently thriving. And Mr. Gurney himself is an example of it.STRICTLY ACADEMICTwo one-act plays by A. R. Gurney.

New Jersey Transit uses computer software that automatically alerts the police when an unattended package shows up on video monitors. The light-rail system in Houston plans to enable its onboard security cameras to transmit live images, wirelessly, to police cruisers. In New York City, which has the largest mass transit system in the United States and is considered the country's most likely target for a terrorist attack, use of cameras is sporadic and not well coordinated. The Metropolitan Transportation Authority uses 5,723 cameras throughout its network, but they are not distributed uniformly; there are none, for instance, in close to half of the city's 468 subway stations.   Since the 1970's, transit agencies across the world have tried, first as a deterrent to combat vandalism, then with greater urgency after terror threats, to prevent and investigate crimes using electronic surveillance. In the United States, these efforts have produced a hodgepodge of systems, some advanced and others barely existent. The need for, and usefulness of, surveillance was given fresh significance after the bombings in London last week, and in particular with the announcement on Tuesday that cameras had evidently helped to identify likely suspects, including at least one presumed suicide bomber. But while cameras were evidently critical in this investigative breakthrough, the London attack also underscored their limitations: the cameras, of course, could not and did not prevent the explosions. Similarly, video cameras captured some of the movements of the Sept. 11 hijackers, but those images chiefly served, in the aftermath of the attacks, as a kind of eerie visual diary. Officials in London, which has one of the most extensive surveillance networks in the world, believed that by making cameras omnipresent they would deter bombers, particularly the Irish Republican Army. ''It obviously does not deter suicide bombers,'' said Brian M. Jenkins, a consultant at the RAND Corporation, a policy research organization, ''but it did have a measurable effect on the I.R.A.'s campaign.'' But the proliferation of cameras came with practical problems, too. ''Unless you have thousands of people watching thousands of cameras, you don't have the same effect as with actual police presence,'' Mr. Jenkins said. In fact, the whole notion of using cameras to fight crime, including terrorism, inside the world's transportation networks is fraught with financial and technological challenges. The traditional model of surveillance cameras -- a bank of monitors with fuzzy black-and-white images, under a person's inattentive gaze -- is being replaced by digital video recorders that transmit, record and store data over fiber-optic or wireless networks. But the new software and wireless enhancements mean that a single custom-built camera can cost over $10,000 to acquire, install and maintain. Nonetheless, the use of video surveillance has already become a major thrust of transit security programs in the United States. ''The technology now allows a very quick replay and return to specific points in time, and much better quality in terms of the resolution of images,'' said Greg Hull, director of operations safety and security at the American Public Transportation Association. The National Transit Institute, a federally funded training and research organization at Rutgers University in New Brunswick, N.J., has studied the new technologies, but Christopher A. Kozub, the associate director for safety and security programs, cautioned that few have been proved to be fail-safe. ''The application of smart technology is only in its embryonic stages,'' he said. ''The potential is there, but variables like temperature conditions, the passenger environment and rush-hour influxes are all very hard to program into these systems.'' Mr. Hull and Mr. Kozub said that no one has rigorously studied the use of cameras by transit agencies across the world. In the United States, transit agencies vary widely in their use of cameras. In San Francisco, the Bay Area Rapid Transit, which opened in 1972, has cameras in all 43 stations, but the system has its limits. Station agents on duty are responsible for monitoring the video screens for their stations, and only some of the stations record and save images. In the past decade, vandalism plummeted after cameras were installed in many of BART's 669 cars. ''We want to enhance them to be all digital, with wireless capability, but we're not there yet,'' said the agency's police chief, Gary Gee, who added that upgrading surveillance systems is a major part of the $200 million antiterror wish list that the agency compiled after Sept. 11. New Jersey Transit, the largest statewide transit agency in the country, uses more than 1,400 cameras across its 11 commuter rail lines, 3 light-rail lines and 240 bus routes. The agency has begun connecting its cameras to computers that can automatically detect suspicious activity, using a complex algorithm. ''Any abnormality that differentiates from the algorithm will set off an alarm or a pager, or give a call to whoever is responsible for that camera,'' said the agency's police chief, Joseph C. Bober. The system can also be used to avoid the cautionary evacuations that have become the norm since Sept. 11. One day last summer, for example, when a suspicious bag was identified at Pennsylvania Station in New York, the agency quickly reviewed recorded images and determined that it had inadvertently been left behind by an employee. In Houston, the Metropolitan Transit Authority of Harris County, Tex., opened a 7.5-mile light-rail line, its first, in January 2004. All 17 stations and 18 cars were equipped with cameras, but the agency is now testing enhancements that would allow the cameras to transmit live images wirelessly to police cruisers and law enforcement centers. In New York City there are 2,328 cameras in 276 stations, but none on the 6,182 subway cars, although the newest ones were built to accommodate them.URL: http://www.nytimes.comLOAD-DATE: July 14, 2005LANGUAGE: ENGLISHGRAPHIC: Photo: At the 50th Street station of the D and M lines in Brooklyn, a camera is mounted on a ceiling beam, to the left of two TV monitors.

But while crossovers are immensely popular and immensely useful, they're also immensely boring.So you've built a five-passenger tall wagon with a V-6 engine, an automatic transmission and all-wheel drive? Join the club. Crossovers are to cars what J. Crew sweaters are to fashion -- useful and dapper enough, but not the most exciting thing you'll ever buy.Mercedes-Benz is obviously aware that the biggest challenge facing a new crossover is the sheer volume of competition. How do you stand out from the crowd? The answer, evidently, is through bombastic styling. The new GLK, the smallest Benz wagon, eschews the generic oblong crossover shape in favor of upright, angular bodywork. Most crossovers seem to have been shaped by the wind. The GLK, meant to evoke the boxy G-Class S.U.V., looks to me as if it were left in the path of a retreating glacier.While the 2010 GLK appears blunt, its coefficient of drag -- the measure of a car's aerodynamic slipperiness -- is only 0.35, the same as a Porsche Cayenne and surely far better than the G-Class. So evidently that bricklike look is a bit of styling trompe l'oeil, with the sharp creases on the bodywork doing their part to butch up a shape that is actually rather aerodynamic.The festival of parallelograms continues inside. While Ford went for a retro '60s feel in the interior of the Mustang, Mercedes chose a different epoch for the GLK interior -- I'm thinking about 1985. The GLK's squared-off console and instrument binnacle make me want to peg my acid-wash jeans and call my friends on a giant beige phone to talk about the new Oingo Boingo album.The central control knob and seven-inch in-dash LCD screen, however, are very up-to-the-minute and quite intuitive to use. Scrolling through radio stations is particularly easy, as the display screen mimics an analog dial and the knurled control knob becomes the tuner, clicking through tactilely satisfying detents as you spin along the dial.The interior can also be optioned up with some of the toys you'd expect on a big S.U.V., like dual rear-seat flat-screen TVs and a panorama glass roof that extends over the rear seats.Like any crossover in search of a bit of street cred, the GLK wears oversize wheels.Nineteen-inch wheels are standard, and my test car was fitted with optional 20-inch alloys. Consequently, I expected the ride to be terrible, as the 20-inch tires have sidewalls about as thick as a Fruit Roll-Up.The first time I realized I was on course for an unavoidable pothole, I winced in anticipation of the front struts' punching their way up through the hood like a football team bursting out of the locker room tunnel. But the suspension soaked up the impact with a mild thump and no further drama.Also, because the GLK doesn't aspire to scale the face of K2, it doesn't suffer the violent side-to-side body roll endemic to tall S.U.V.'s that try to avoid heeling over like an America's Cup racer in corners. The GLK drives a lot like the C-Class sedan on which it is based, and that's a high compliment.The GLK also shares its propulsion -- a 268-horsepower 3.5-liter V-6 and a 7-speed automatic transmission -- with the C350 Sport. This is plenty of power, even with roughly 4,000 pounds of GLK to lug around.Mercedes estimates the 0-to-60 time at about 6.5 seconds, and with the seven-speed transmission the GLK is always handy with the perfect gear to squirt through a gap in traffic. This motor makes pleasant noises, too; most of the time you don't hear it at all, but when you step on the accelerator the exhaust awakens with a pleasing melodic snarl.It speaks well for the GLK that its engine and transmission also find a home in the E-Class, which plays in the mid-$50,000 range and thus carries expectations for powertrain excellence.Speaking of money, the base rear-drive GLK is priced at $34,775, which is some $5,100 less than the C350 sedan. All-wheel drive adds $2,000. That is extremely aggressive pricing, and it undercuts the aging BMW X3 by several thousand dollars. It's a sign of the times when a Mercedes wagon begs to be considered from a value perspective.That value proposition ends at the Mobil station, since the Environmental Protection Agency's estimated fuel economy for the GLK350 4Matic is 16 miles a gallon in the city and 21 on the highway. On both counts, that is only 1 m.p.g. better than the ratings for the bigger ML350 4Matic.Still, I recently drove an ML320 Bluetec diesel that returned 28 m.p.g. on a two-hour highway trip. If that powertrain ever finds its way into the GLK, Mercedes will have a mini mileage champ on its hands.But with fuel cheap and consumers feeling parsimonious, a GLK Bluetec probably isn't going to happen soon. The question facing the GLK and the rest of the smaller premium crossovers -- Acura RDX, Audi Q5, BMW X3, Volvo XC60 and so on -- is what they deliver above and beyond the herd of mainstream tall wagons.The GLK, for instance, offers 268 horsepower, all-wheel-drive and a cabin full of leather. Well, so do the Toyota RAV4, the Ford Edge and the Hyundai Veracruz, plus or minus 8 horsepower.With the GLK, the extra money doesn't buy you extra room or power, but a finer driving experience. This vehicle isn't a rude attempt to cash in on brand equity (see the late, unlamented Jaguar X-Type) or a sad little Benz that screams, ''This is the cheapest Mercedes I could lease!'' (See the former C-Class coupe.)No, it is a fully realized Mercedes, with a powertrain fit for the S-Class -- indeed, one that is offered in the S-Class in Europe.On paper, the GLK is an expensive RAV4, but behind the wheel it's a C350 Sport with a $5,000 discount.INSIDE TRACK: Mercedes plays the value card.URL: http://www.nytimes.comLOAD-DATE: September 10, 2011LANGUAGE: ENGLISHGRAPHIC: PHOTOS: TO BE BLUNT: Mercedes sets its GLK apart from the compact crossover crowd with styling that is upright and angular.BEST OF THE '80S: Squared-off dash design calls for the Go-Go's greatest hits.

But the Interfax news agency cited an unidentified official close to the investigation as saying the case had been effectively solved. It said the fate of about 70 of the works, including where they had been sold, had been established, although it was not clear whether any of the items had since been found. Interfax, as well as state television channels and other news agencies, said the two suspects, who were not identified, stole the works with the help of a curator who had been responsible for the storeroom where the majority of the items, valued in total at $5 million, were kept.  According to the Hermitage's initial statements disclosing the thefts, the curator died, evidently late last year, prompting an audit of the museum's collection that uncovered the scheme. A spokeswoman for the Hermitage, Larisa A. Korubeynikova, said in a telephone interview that the museum was aware of the arrests but had no confirmation from officials involved in the investigation, which the country's General Prosecutor's Office announced it was taking over on Friday.  The heist has caused a sensation here, prompting laments over the security of one of the world's premier museums and a culture of corruption that, apparently, extended to the sanctity of a renowned cultural institution. This week the museum's director, Mikhail Piotrovsky, called the thefts ''a stab in the back'' and promised greater scrutiny of his workers. The curator has not been officially named, but news reports have identified her as Larisa Zavadskaya. Some reports on Saturday said one of the suspects was her husband, but Ms. Korubeynikova said that did not appear likely.  The arrests, if confirmed, would represent a swift resolution to the case, which was disclosed on Monday. It remains to be seen, though, whether all of the artworks will be recovered and returned. The Hermitage posted a detailed list of the missing items on its Web site, www.hermitagemuseum.org, and appealed for help in finding them. That appeared to have had results.  An antiquities dealer in Moscow on Friday turned in a 19th-century gold and silver chalice that, according to the official Russian Information Agency, he had purchased in 2004, unaware of its illicit provenance. The day before an anonymous caller directed the authorities in St. Petersburg to a garbage bin, where they found an icon that appeared to be another of the stolen works.  Ms. Korubeynikova said it was premature to say definitely that the two works discovered so far were among those stolen. She also cautioned against a rush to judgment against the museum's workers. ''Museum people are honest people,'' she said. ''Otherwise our museums would be empty by now.''URL: http://www.nytimes.comLOAD-DATE: August 6, 2006LANGUAGE: ENGLISHCORRECTION-DATE: August 10, 2006CORRECTION: An article on Aug. 1 in The Arts about the theft of 221 objects from the State Hermitage Museum in St. Petersburg, Russia, and an article on Sunday about two arrests in the case each rendered incorrectly from Russian Cyrillic the surname of the museum's spokeswoman.

A 1911 family melodrama written by a young Englishwoman, Githa Sowerby, the play has the emotional depth, narrative pull and linguistic potency to retain an impact today.     In fact, it is a hefty, ambitious and sneakily complicated piece of work, keenly attuned to the societal divisions in the Britain of its time: between generations, between regions, between economic classes, between Victorian and 20th-century morality and between the sexes. It's a lot to take on for a small company with a small stage, and unfortunately, for all the good will the Mint players bring to the production, the play more or less defeats them.   "Rutherford and Son," Sowerby's first play, was received to acclaim, and the author was subsequently described by the early feminist Emma Goldman as history's first significant female playwright. She wrote other plays, but none achieved anything close to renown, and she has more or less fallen off the radar screen in spite of an evidently successful revival of "Rutherford and Son" at the Royal National Theater in London in 1994. In any case, she's new to me as a playwright, and even the most cursory information about her is tough to come by.She was born in 1876, grew up in northern England, the locale of "Rutherford," and was living in London when she wrote the play, apparently taking time out from her day job, making fairy-tale books with her sister Millicent, an illustrator. There are parallels to the playwright's family in some of the play's characters, but it is not, evidently, a genuinely autobiographical work; her father was a landscape painter and not the tyrannical and closed-minded businessman that the title character is.In the play, John Rutherford views his tyranny over his home and business -- a glassworks -- as a necessity for overcoming wretched lower-class status, a status that he believes his family has escaped through hard work. But as the play opens, the business is struggling and is dependent on the development of a new process that was accidentally discovered by his elder son, John Jr., a somewhat feckless fellow with half-baked aspirations to high society whose Edwardian perspective on good fortune differs from his father's Victorian severity; he's a yuppie, of sorts. And he refuses to yield the formula for his process until his father pays him for it.That, however, is the most skeletal of plot outlines; the eight characters include the elder Rutherford's other feckless son, Richard, who has become a priest; his daughter, Janet, a self-loathing spinster who is carrying on a passionate affair in secret with her father's hired manager; and John Jr.'s wife, Mary, an office worker who met her husband in London before being dragged to misery in the north, where she is treated by the family with a damp chill for being an outsider, for on the one hand being city-soft and on the other not being the society girl who would raise her husband to the more gentle class he affects.Both Janet and Mary feels colossally oppressed in the stifling patriarchal autocracy that the family -- isolated by its affluence in a small town that is itself isolated on the moors -- has become. And the playwright, obviously sensitive to characters closest to her in age and temperament, has given them the stiffest spines in the play. They must suffer for their liberation, and they do.The other characters include a couple of mouthpieces. One is Rutherford Sr.'s sister, Ann, a dour and unquestioning woman of 60 or so who clearly represents the unpleasantness of the narrow-minded life her brother has built around them. The other is a townswoman who has come to plead with Rutherford to hire back her son, who has stolen some money from the factory; their scene together, polemical but nonetheless well written, is about the cruelties of class warfare. Over all, in the network of relationships -- quite knotted and interesting -- Sowerby obviously constructed a backdrop for social conflicts that seem not only period-true but resonant.One doesn't wish to be too crusty with a production that does the welcome task of reintroducing such a worthy work, but alas, the play itself transcends its treatment here.The set, done in neat brick and furnished with apparently store-bought faux antiques, looks more like the interior of a brand new summer cottage in, say, the Maine woods than a turn-of-the-century family home on the moors. With the exception of Jurian Hughes, whose Janet seems genuinely to emanate from within, the cast is game but overmatched (and in a couple of cases hapless); most of the players spend more effort straining with the regional patois than making their characters engage with one another.And under Richard Corley's relentlessly humorless direction, not one of them shows the flicker of a smile until more than two of the play's nearly three hours have passed. Finally, the production seems more overwhelmed than overjoyed by the effort of mounting the play.RUTHERFORD AND SONBy Githa Sowerby; directed by Richard Corley; sets by Vicki Davis; costumes by Charlotte Palmer-Lane; lighting by Jeff Nellis; sound by Ellen Mandel; hair and wig design by the Broadway Wig Company; properties specialist, Judi Guralnick; dialect coach, Amy Stoller; production stage manager, Sara E.

They said it appeared to indicate that the fire, evidently in connection with a partial or total reactor-core meltdown, continued out of control.The accident, which Western diplomats said evidently occurred last weekend or earlier, sent an immense cloud of radioactivity, measured by Swedish experts at roughly 100 times normal levels, across Northern European countries.West German officials said they were coordinating a search for technical advice from chemical companies, like Bayer A.G. and Hoechst A.G., that are major suppliers of graphite, and for assistance in supplying technical equipment, such as remote-control robots, and trained personnel from organizations such as Germany's Nuclear Technology Assistance Service, a kind of fire brigade maintained by the nuclear-power industry to deal with serious accidents.But officials in both countries said they were hampered by a lack of information, and were limited in the type of assistance they could offer because of the absence in their countries of the type of reactor, using graphite components, involved in Chernobyl.West Germany and Sweden are world leaders in the manufacture and maintenance of nuclear power generating equipment. Germany operates 20 nuclear power stations and 5 more are in the planning stage. But only one uses graphite.Margareta Hallencreutz, an official at the Swedish Nuclear Inspection Board in Stockholm, said a Soviet Embassy third technical secretary sought ''technical advice'' in talks today with five officials of the Swedish agency. But she said the diplomat ''did not know the reason'' for the fire and ''did not know the extent of the damage done.''Frigyes Reich, a Board member, was quoted earlier as saying that ''the nuclear plant's graphite moderator is burning and the core of the reactor has melted, in part or even completely.'' Report Called 'Speculation'But Mrs. Hallencreutz said that was ''speculation.'' ''We just do not know,'' she said. Adolf Birkhofer, director of the West German Society for Reactor Safety and a leading European expert, said the presence of elements such as Cesium 134 and Cesium 137 in the atmosphere appeared to indicate a partial or total meltdown, of the reactor core and its possible exposure to air.''Evidently there was a loss of coolant, and a malfunctioning of the reserve capacity,'' Mr. Birkhofer said in a telephone interview. Exposure would have led to a graphite-oxygen reaction and subsequent smoldering, he said.Mr. Birkhofer described the disaster as a ''design-basis accident,'' indicating that safety systems had evidently proven insufficient. Asked whether it could be considered the most serious such accident ever, he replied, ''Yes, judging by available information.'' Experience With Graphite FiresMrs. Hallencreutz said Sweden was able to give no technical advice, but referred the Soviet official to countries, such as the United States, Britain and Switzerland, which had experience in dealing with graphite fires.Officials of the German Atom Forum in Bonn, an organization linking industries and scientific groups involved in atomic energy, said they met for two to three hours this morning with a Soviet Embassy ''scientific official'' to coordinate contacts with companies and organizations capable of supplying aid.A spokesman said the organizations included the Nuclear Technology Assistance Service, the German Nuclear Energy Research Center in Julich, west of Bonn, and the Society for Reactor Safety, in Cologne. Team of Experts AvailableWolfgang Neumann, technical director of the Nuclear Technology Assistance Service, which is operated jointly by utilities that run atomic power plants, said it had available a team of about 133 trained experts, as well as specialized equipment, including four remote-control robots and other machinery used in handling reactor accidents involving high radioactivity.Mr. Neumann said the Nuclear Technology Assistance Service could also supply equipment, such as suits amd containers, to shield against radiation, that could be flown to the Soviet Union.But he said further detailed information about the accident was neeeded before officials could decide what form of aid was necessary. He said Soviet Embassy officials in Bonn promised to supply further information, but had not yet done so.At the same time, the Soviet Union was reported to be seeking assistance from individual companies. Officials of Brown Boveri, in Mannheim, West Germany, a subsidiary of the Swiss engineering company of the same name, said Soviet representatives had asked it for expert advice.LANGUAGE: ENGLISHCopyright 1986 The New York Times Company11 of 50 DOCUMENTSThe New York TimesMarch 4, 2004 Thursday  Late Edition - FinalComcast Sees an Opening To Push Its Unsolicited BidBYLINE: By GERALDINE FABRIKANT; Jill P. Capuzzo, in Philadelphia, contributed reporting for this article.SECTION: Section C; Column 4; Business/Financial Desk; Pg. 4LENGTH: 542 wordsComcast used the staggering no-confidence vote against Michael D. Eisner yesterday as an opportunity to once again press its takeover agenda, issuing a news release that demanded a meeting with the independent directors of the Walt Disney Company.  But Comcast can evidently count on little support from Disney's restive shareholders. When a professional investor gadfly, Evelyn Y. Davis, mentioned Comcast at yesterday's Disney annual meeting in Philadelphia, the audience booed.  Comcast, the nation's largest cable company, made an unsolicited $54 billion bid for Disney three weeks ago, which the Disney board rejected.  Though the value of the offer -- $23.72 a share -- is well below Disney's closing price of $26.65, Comcast said yesterday that it wanted ''to present the benefits of the merger'' to Disney's independent directors.  A Comcast spokesman said the company had no plans to raise its bid. Comcast said late yesterday that it had received no response from Disney or its board to the news release. Many Disney shareholders, whatever their feelings about Mr. Eisner, evidently do not see Comcast as a white knight.  In random interviews with various shareholders leaving Disney's annual meeting, investors generally voiced distaste for a merger -- whether because they consider Disney an American icon that should remain independent, or because negative experiences with the cable industry had left them skeptical that a cable operator would provide the level of customer service that Disney is known for at its theme parks.  ''Disney has always put the customer first,'' said Delores Mickus of Holland, Pa., who is a shareholder and said her family goes to Walt Disney World in Florida three or four times a year. ''Comcast is a monopoly and it is not service oriented,'' she said. ''They know they have you over a barrel.''  Some stockholders who have held Disney shares for years said that they had a personal connection to the company that left little room for Comcast.  ''That is not a company I would like to see buy Disney,'' said Dan Erdly of Blackwood, N.J., who wore a maroon Mickey Mouse tie to yesterday's meeting.  ''Disney is more than a company. It is part of Americana,'' Mr. Erdly said. ''It's a sacred institution. I would not want to see it tampered with by a company that wants to exploit it only for a couple of its assets.''  Of course, the real power resides with institutional shareholders, which own about 60 percent of Disney's stock. ''Eisner's loss is not necessarily Comcast's victory,'' Patrick McGurn, special counsel to the influential advisory firm Institutional Shareholder Services, said yesterday.  ''Shareholders idolize Mickey Mouse and the rest of the characters, and they might be hostile to any sort of change of control or takeover,'' Mr. McGurn said. ''The vote today had nothing to do with the Comcast bid. That will have to be judged on its own merits.''  Brad Pacheco, a spokesman for the California Public Employees' Retirement System, which owns 9.9 million Disney shares, said that the vote against Mr. Eisner did not change Calpers view of the Comcast offer, which he said ''is not high enough.''  The right price? ''We'll know it when we see it,'' Mr. Pacheco said.                       URL: http://www.nytimes.comLOAD-DATE: March 4, 2004LANGUAGE: ENGLISHPUBLICATION-TYPE: NewspaperCopyright 2004 The New York Times Company12 of 50 DOCUMENTSThe New York TimesDecember 28, 2004 Tuesday  Late Edition - FinalDoes Sitting in Coach Make You Want to Cry?BYLINE: By Joe Sharkey. E-mail: jsharkey@nytimes.comSECTION: Section C; Column 5; Business/Financial Desk; BUSINESS TRAVEL: ON THE ROAD; Pg. 6LENGTH: 914 wordsI was in coach, bound for southwest Florida. Because I have platinum status on Continental, I can usually avoid coach. But not last Thursday, when the front of the plane was filled with passengers who had evidently actually paid the first-class fare, leaving no seats available for upgrades. Forty-five minutes after takeoff, it became clear why first class was so popular over the holidays. In coach, a woman in the aisle seat across from me began shrieking that she was going to sue the airline because a flight attendant opening a soda can for a child had inadvertently sprayed some soda on her. ''I will never fly with the cattle again!'' the woman vowed. There must have been two dozen children under 10 on the flight, many of them chattering, fidgeting or whining.  The line for the lavatory stretched down the narrow aisle. A tiny curly-haired toddler, of the age when children seem to be able to move with the speed of lightning, scampered up the aisle through the adult legs and deftly snatched a stranger's reading glasses on her way. A flight attendant directly in front of me crouched to block the streaking toddler, but I could see the child was a running back who had spotted a hole in the defense. ''I'll get her if she gets by you,'' I assured the flight attendant. The little girl was giggling when we caught her. I gave the guy his glasses back. The child was escorted toward the rear of the plane, where her parents had evidently blinked for the half-second she needed to flee.  By the galley, another flight attendant was cleaning up one of the two lavatories. A young boy waiting in line for the one operating lavatory in coach was dancing the little jig that every parent recognizes as a two-minute warning. ''I got to goooooo!'' he wailed. Still, except for the woman with the pending soda-spray litigation, I did not detect any evidence that adult passengers seemed to mind the commotion that much. Holiday periods are the only times when business travelers mingle with large numbers of parents and children on leisure trips (including parents who are themselves business travelers at other times of the year). And from my observation on that and other holiday flights, business travelers usually behave with both empathy and kindness under the stress. Last week's column, focusing on anxieties parents have about the possibility of their children annoying other passengers, elicited a big response. Except for a few predictable cranks like the one quoted last week who said that infants should be sedated with a shot of Jack Daniel's before flying, if they are allowed to fly at all, most readers sounded sympathetic, helpful and mindful of their own experiences traveling with infants and toddlers. Ann Karnovsky cautioned against the idea, once widely held, that small children should be dosed with medicine (though not with whiskey) on a long flight. She recalled a long-ago 17-hour flight from New York to Johannesburg with her husband and their son Danny, then 18 months old. On the advice of a pediatrician, she had given Danny a small dose of an antihistamine that, she said, had a counterproductive effect. ''Danny walked almost the whole distance between the States and South Africa,'' she said. Dozens of readers mentioned that parents should give infants a pacifier or a bottle, and small children a piece of candy or something else to suck on, during takeoff and landing. Changes in cabin pressure at these times can cause sharp pain that toddlers do not know how to alleviate by clearing their ears.  Charlotte Raynor said she appreciated my suggestion last week that Jack Daniel's should be administered not to the child but to the anxious parent. ''I want to share the advice our pediatrician gave us for making several cross-country flights with our daughter, starting at 5 months old,'' she wrote.  Ms. Raynor said that along with the advice about ways to avoid ear pain, the pediatrician prescribed a dose of Dimetapp, an over-the-counter cold remedy, during the flight to induce sleepiness. ''This formula worked like a charm for us until she was old enough to be entertained during flight by books, games or tapes (with headphones),'' she said. Clearly her experience was different from Ann Karnovsky's. In the same vein, Greg Sleter and many others suggested that it was the responsibility of the parents to prepare children for airplane travel with toys, books and other diversions. ''As a parent of a 7-month-old and a 5-year-old, my annoyance when I'm on a flight with kids has shifted in recent years from the kids to the parents,'' he wrote. ''It is not up to the airlines to provide entertainment'' for children, he said. ''That responsibility falls to the parents.'' Finally -- and this will resonate with those of you who were stuck in the air travel mess over the weekend -- William Edwards had what I thought was a very trenchant observation about flying and children. He recalled being in coach on a transcontinental flight, filled to capacity with 200 passengers. ''It was miserable. The air was foul, the service impossible,'' he wrote. The plane was full of ''smelly heavy coats and carry-on baggage,'' he added. ''After about an hour, a young child started to cry very loudly.'' Then it occurred to him that the crying child was responding appropriately to the situation, unlike the 199 other passengers. ''I felt good the rest of the flight,'' he said. ''At least someone was complaining.''On the Road appears each Tuesday.URL: http://www.nytimes.comLOAD-DATE: December 28, 2004LANGUAGE: ENGLISHGRAPHIC: Drawing (Drawing by Chris Gash)      PUBLICATION-TYPE: NewspaperCopyright 2004 The New York Times Company13 of 50 DOCUMENTSThe New York TimesOctober 1, 2004 Friday  Late Edition - FinalThieves Make Off With 2 Rare Gems in Broad LimelightBYLINE: By CRAIG S. SMITHSECTION: Section A; Column 3; Foreign Desk; Paris Journal; Pg. 4LENGTH: 918 wordsDATELINE: PARIS, Sept. 30 It was a crime worthy of the cleverest comic book jewel thief. Amid the murmur of well-coiffed grandes dames and their pinstriped husbands browsing among some of the most expensive antiques and works of art in the world, two large and prominently displayed diamonds worth as much as $14 million vanished into thin air. ''No one saw anything,'' said Christian Deydier, the exquisitely postured president of the National Syndicate of Antique Dealers, who organized the event where the theft occurred, the group's 22nd Biennial, a sort of periodic, movable museum where everything is for sale.  That is remarkable, because the diamonds were sparkling beneath a brightly lighted cubical glass cover standing on a chest-high wooden pedestal at the entrance to a small, openfront showroom.  It is all the more remarkable because four saleswomen and two security guards working for Chopard, the elegant Swiss jeweler, kept watch over just six identical display cases in the 150-square-foot space. At just after 3 on Monday afternoon, when the theft took place, the diamonds should have been in plain view of a dozen or more people. The Biennial, which since 1994 has been held in a subterranean gallery deep beneath the Arc de Triomphe du Carrousel near the entrance to the Louvre, brings together some of the most stylish culture merchants in Europe every other year.  The latest gathering, which ended Tuesday, included more than 100 exhibitors offering about 8,000 items, including a 1948 mobile by Calder and a painting by Gustave Courbet recently discovered in a false attic floor. The Calder sold for about $4 million and the Courbet was put on reserve by an unidentified museum. The very rich and the well-connected -- President Jacques Chirac, for example, or the New York financier Henry Kravis -- were given private tours. The rest paid about $15 to stroll the dimly lighted halls, peering at Bruegels or gray limestone Buddhas or 18th-century French chairs while white-jacketed waiters pushed carts offering Champagne.  Altogether, nearly 80,000 people visited the two-week show. But not everyone was looking at the artworks. Some people were evidently studying the skimpy security surrounding the costly baubles. A saleswoman at the Chopard showroom now said the jeweler was visited on several occasions by men speaking English with Slavic accents. What the men apparently discovered was that Chopard had no visible video cameras and that its display cases did not appear to be rigged with alarms. The police say the thieves may have verified that last point by asking a saleswoman to take a piece of jewelry out of one of the cases for closer inspection. Chopard will not discuss its security measures, and Mr. Deydier sniffs at suggestions that the Biennial was underprotected. But the band of thieves evidently found the defenses flimsy enough to mount a daring raid using one of the oldest pickpocket ploys in the book: distraction. ''Suddenly it got very crowded and there were people asking each of the saleswomen for something,'' said a Chopard employee, who asked not to be identified, standing outside the showroom the day after the robbery. ''One wanted a catalog. Another wanted information on a piece of jewelry.'' She said the men sounded like East Europeans. When the rush cleared, the diamonds were gone. Inside the showroom late Wednesday, several men in gray suits studied the now empty case, murmuring and pointing to the wooden trim along its bottom edge where the lock had evidently been sprung. One man tilted the glass box up, opening it like the hood of a car, to demonstrate how the thief had slipped his hand inside. Chopard has declined to describe the theft in greater detail, but Mr. Deydier said there had been four diamonds on display and two had been stolen: a near-thumb-size white diamond of 47 carats and a smaller blue one of 15.74 carats. In their haste the thieves left behind still more valuable pink and yellow stones. Detectives at France's Brigade de Repression du Banditisme say there is little chance of recovering the diamonds. They say the gems are probably somewhere in Eastern Europe or Russia by now.  While it will be nearly impossible to sell such easily recognizable stones on the open market, they say, the diamonds can be recut and then sold. The police say there are also plenty of private buyers in Russia and the Arab world willing to accept a discount in return for leaving difficult questions unanswered. The French news media were quick to draw analogies with the country's famous fictional gentleman burglar, Arsene Lupin, and the caper might make Americans think of Cary Grant's dapper character in ''To Catch a Thief.'' But the police say the real thieves, though skilled, are probably far less refined. Eastern European gangs have been raiding European jewelry shops increasingly in recent years. Last year two men, Nebojsa Denic, a Kosovo Serb, and Pedja Vujosevic, also known as Marco the Montenegrin, pulled off the biggest diamond caper in Britain's history, stealing $40 million worth of gems.  Mr. Denic was tackled during the getaway and is in jail, and Mr. Vujosevic was later arrested in Paris. But only about $5 million worth of the diamonds have been recovered. The Chopard jewels were insured by the Allianz Group of Germany, which has sent an investigator to check on the security measures that were in place. An Allianz spokesman said the company would wait for the results before deciding whether it would indemnify Chopard's loss.URL: http://www.nytimes.comLOAD-DATE: October 1, 2004LANGUAGE: ENGLISHGRAPHIC: Photo: The scene in the Perrin booth at the 22nd Biennial of the National Syndicate of Antique Dealers.

Other major carriers, with the possible exception of Continental Airlines (which maintained most in-flight free-meal service when competitors cut back or eliminated theirs last year), are considering a similar move, or toying with alternatives like selling food at gates.  America West conducted the most extensive testing over a three-week period that ended Sunday on a total of about 250 of its flights out of Phoenix. The first week's selection was snack boxes for $3. The next week, hot lunches and breakfasts were offered for $5. Last week, they rolled out a hot dinner menu for $10. On a flight from Phoenix to Raleigh-Durham, N.C., last Wednesday, Joette Schmidt, the vice president for customer and in-flight service at America West, happened to be sitting in a coach seat across the aisle from me. She was poring over a thick stack of survey forms filled in by passengers who had been asked to evaluate the experiment."Over all, we know one thing at this point, that we have customer acceptance on the concept," she reported. "The surveys are overwhelmingly positive. Even if they didn't purchase a meal on a particular flight, over 80 percent indicated that they would in the future."Yes, I know there are people out there saying: "Honey, get a load of this baloney! Airlines used to give you meals for free; now they're charging for them, and claiming that customers like the idea." Yet it appears to be true. Among the reasons are that a good number of passengers evidently dislike purchasing take-out food in the airport and lugging it through security and onto the plane. Also, some passengers evidently dislike even more the prospect of airplane cabins becoming redolent with the sights, smells and spills of other people's take-out favorites. Further, many passengers understand that advance-purchase domestic air fares are as low as they can go, that airlines continue to lose billions a year, and that free full-meal service in domestic coach seats is not likely to return."We heard from so many customers that they don't have the time" or the desire to buy food in airports to carry on, Ms. Schmidt said. "They're saying, 'We understand airline economics; we want you to stay in business; we want you to keep our ticket prices low, so just give us the option to buy something on board.' "On my four-hour flight to Raleigh, I had the chicken Kiev, which came on a china dish with a baked potato, green beans, a tomato and mushroom salad, bread sticks and a big Cadbury chocolate bar. The other choice was beef tenderloin, with comparable accompaniments. Now, I'm no food critic, but I do know the difference between good grub and granola, and I'm here to tell you that the America West $10 dinner was better than any meal I've had in a first-class seat on a domestic flight in the last 18 months. According to the passenger surveys, those who opted to buy the America West meals liked the food. Among those who did not buy, many said they would if they had known about the option in advance. Others wanted more selections, including cheaper dinner prices, and perhaps a kid's meal. Some said that paying by credit card would be good. One guy just wasn't happy at all, however. "Serve only cold food! The plane stinks like a lousy diner from the hot meals," he scrawled on his form. To my surprise, none of the America West flight attendants I spoke to at airports or on the plane expressed a complaint. "At first I thought I was going to be embarrassed selling food, but the passengers liked it so much that it was no problem," one said. Another was relieved that take-out packaging might be reduced. A women's soccer team recently brought pizzas on a flight, "and we could barely find a place to stack the empty boxes," she said. The for-sale meals fit on the standard food cart, and the dishes and trash can be stowed easily, another said. No one really knows yet whether this idea will actually fly on a wide scale. Northwest will continue its food-sale tests through Feb. 15, on 12 flights a day (out of a total of 1,500), said Kurt Ebenhoch, a spokesman. Northwest's test-menu items, like America West's, are prepared by LSG Sky Chefs, the big airline caterer, which has been aggressively promoting the idea. Caterers have been badly hurt as airlines eliminate meals on many flights.America West executives are evaluating the passenger response and the logistical questions, Ms. Schmidt said. Can the system handle expanded selections, or will the limited menus be enough? Can credit cards be processed on board? Is there a way to let customers buy meal vouchers when they book reservations without making it look like some kind of back-door fare increase?If the airline decides to approve the idea, "it will probably be a phase-in, with simple items first, 45 days or so forward," Ms. Schmidt said. There is no rush, she added. "The traveling public, particularly the frequent traveler such as the business traveler, realizes right now that airlines need to be focused on core competencies, such as, let's get you there safely, on time, and hopefully with your luggage with you. They're saying, 'Do that; give me value for what I pay for.' Anything else, like food, is a customer-service option." URL: http://www.nytimes.com LOAD-DATE: January 28, 2003  LANGUAGE: ENGLISH GRAPHIC: Drawing (Chris Gash)      PUBLICATION-TYPE: NewspaperCopyright 2003 The New York Times Company15 of 50 DOCUMENTSThe New York TimesApril 5, 2013 Friday  Late Edition - FinalFinding A Rate That's Fairer Than LiborBYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS. Floyd Norris comments on finance and the economy at nytimes.com/economix.SECTION: Section B; Column 0; Business/Financial Desk; HIGH & LOW FINANCE; Pg. 1LENGTH: 1434 wordsPerhaps it is time to feel sorry for the big banks, at least when it comes to Libor. If they do what some regulators want, it appears they will be directly defying other regulators. If they do what those other regulators want, they may end up facing criminal charges.Libor, if you have not been paying attention, is the London interbank offered rate -- or rates, since there are dozens of them. For decades, it has been the dominant determinant of floating interest rates, with trillions of dollars in loans and derivatives priced off those rates.Now it is ridiculous. It purports to be the rate at which banks can borrow from each other. Every day banks submit the rates at which they could borrow money, on an unsecured basis, in various currencies and varying maturities. Those rates are averaged, after the highest and lowest ones are eliminated, and that becomes that day's Libor rate.These days there is a problem: banks almost never borrow from each other, particularly at longer maturities. So the rates are fictitious -- or at least not based on any information that could be verified. Before, during and after the credit crisis, the rates were being manipulated by bankers, often with the approval of top management. Sometimes the motive was to make the bank look better -- what does it say about a bank if its peers evidently will not lend money to it at the same rate they will lend to others? -- but other times the motive was just to rig markets so traders could make money. It was sort of like betting on a soccer match: profits are much more likely if you fix the match before you place your bet.Three major banks -- Barclays, UBS and the Royal Bank of Scotland -- were fined a total of $2.5 billion by authorities in Britain and the United States. It appeared to be a fine case of international regulatory cooperation.But now that cooperation is breaking down. In the United States, Gary Gensler, the chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and the man whose determination to do something helped to expose criminal behavior that evidently did not seem all that outrageous to some others, is pushing to get rid of Libor entirely. He argues that it no longer really exists, assuming it ever did, and wants to find a new benchmark for floating interest rate contracts.But Britain and the European Commission appear to be determined to save Libor. This week new governance rules took effect in Britain, and the European Commission is moving in the same direction. The new rules call for better governance, with efforts made to assure there is no cheating by traders.Some banks, understandably, would just as soon get out of a business that has sullied reputations and cost billions. Some have tried to resign from the panels that determine Libor and its cousin, Euribor, a similar but less widely used system of base rates. But both European and British regulators view the existence of the benchmarks as critical and have warned banks not to leave.''Interbank interest rate benchmarks are of systemic importance,'' said Michel Barnier, the European commissioner in charge of markets. He said European legislation would force banks to submit rates.To Mr. Gensler, the Europeans are moving in the wrong direction. ''We have seen a significant amount of publicly available market data that raises questions about the integrity of Libor today,'' he said in a speech last month. He said that there was very little unsecured interbank trading going on, and that even when other interest rates fluctuated widely -- rates that include credit-default swaps on the very same banks -- each bank tended to submit the same rates day after day.He noted that a task force of the International Organization of Securities Commissions recommended earlier this year that ''a benchmark should as a matter of priority be anchored by observable transactions entered into at arm's length between buyers and sellers in order for it to function as a credible indicator of prices, rates or index values,'' adding, ''I agree with this.''To put it mildly, there is no reason to think the interbank lending market fits that bill now, and there are reasons to think it will be even less true in the future. Mr. Gensler said some banks believed the new Basel capital rules regarding liquidity would make it prohibitively expensive for one bank to lend to another for more than 30 days at a time. If so, there will be no such lending.Mr. Gensler would like to develop an alternative and points to two options. One would essentially be dependent on the federal funds rate -- the rate at which banks lend reserves to one another. The other would be based on rates charged on secured loans. In each case these are real markets, at least in dollar-based transactions. He would like to phase in one of them as a replacement for Libor.Whether such a tactic could work is not clear. There are a lot of contracts in existence based on Libor, and changing them by legal fiat might not pass judicial muster. And Mr. Gensler's suggested way of doing that raises its own questions. Essentially, he would allow derivatives based on Libor to keep trading for a couple of years while derivatives based on the new interest rates also traded, and in that way establish relationships between the two rates. So if Libor was, on average, 30 basis points above a new rate, then a Libor contract calling for interest payments of 200 basis points over Libor would be converted into a contract calling for paying 230 basis points more than the new rate.A major problem with that is that to establish the relationship between the two rates depends on treating the Libor rates as if they are real. The fact they are not is the major problem Mr. Gensler sees in the current system.The new British rules, as proposed, called for auditors to certify bank Libor policies every year, and allowed private lawsuits by persons or institutions who believed they had been harmed by manipulative and inaccurate Libor submissions. But banks complained that regular audits might cost so much that the requirement would ''adversely affect the incentives for firms to participate in the benchmark.''When the final rules came out last week, they made a couple of important changes. Audits may be less frequent than every year. And private lawsuits would be prohibited in Britain.Whether such suits can proceed in the United States is unclear.A federal judge in New York has allowed some claims of commodity price manipulation to proceed, although she rejected others because reports of possible problems in the Libor market, starting in 2007, meant that the statute of limitations had expired.It is not clear whether statute of limitations issues could derail a suit filed by Freddie Mac, the government-owned mortgage company, against the banks that set Libor and the British Bankers Association, which administered it. Freddie argued that it had entered into many contracts under which it received payments based on Libor. If the banks depressed those rates by submitting artificially low rates, as some have admitted, Freddie was harmed. It would be interesting if the courts ruled that because everyone should have known the market was fixed, those who fixed it are not liable.There seems to be no way to turn Libor into a legitimate rate, given the way market perceptions of banks have changed. So any bank that submits rates that do not accurately reflect what it would have to pay may be subject to future legal action in the United States. But any bank that raises the rates it submits could raise doubts about its own creditworthiness. And the Europeans plan to make banks continue to submit rates.Although it is not a case that any bank has made publicly, it could be argued that the spirit of Libor was preserved by the banks that lied. It was originally intended as a virtually risk-free private sector interest rate.An accurate Libor, from 2007 on, would have reflected the banks' poorer credit, and would therefore no longer be such a risk-free rate. A borrower paying 100 basis points over Libor would wind up paying a premium over a real risk-free rate that was much larger than it had agreed to pay. Overcharging borrowers would not have helped the economy recover from the Great Recession.Libor has clearly become ridiculous. But long before that happened, it became ubiquitous. Europe wants to preserve the latter, even if it does leave the former in place indefinitely. A better course would be to find a rate whose meaning will not change over time, and base future contracts on it. A rate based on secured loans makes the most sense.URL: http://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/05/business/steering-a-better-course-past-the-fiction-of-libor.htmlLOAD-DATE: April 6, 2013LANGUAGE: ENGLISHGRAPHIC: PHOTOS: Melissa Eddy reported from Frankfurt and Jack Ewing from London.

Unlike their descendants on Sunday, they lost, 46-10, to the Chicago Bears, who sacked Mr. Eason three times. That was a tough day for him, but nothing like the ordeal being conjured for him nightly in "Runt of the Litter," a solo show at the MCC Theater, which just happens to be written and performed by his younger brother, Bo.     Bo Eason was a pro football player as well, a defensive back for the Houston Oilers, but he was always the smaller, less talented and less celebrated Eason on the gridiron. And it is evidently this sibling dynamic, a prototypical rivalry, from which has sprung this blustery and aggrandized tale of modern gladiators, obsession, testosterone and revenge.   The show was directed by Larry Moss, who also helped shape "The Syringa Tree," a more convincing solo coming-of-age story in which an adult recapitulates an extraordinary childhood. For though Mr. Eason brings genuine experience to his presentation, "Runt of the Litter" ultimately shuns the interesting authenticity of his life as a contemporary warrior in favor of overblown mythic aspirations, which Mr. Moss has evidently encouraged. The show gives the Henry brothers, who are the stand-ins for the Easons, the stature of a contemporary Hector and Achilles. And O.K., the Henrys are supposed to be fictional characters, but the show sure makes you wonder about Bo Eason's lingering resentments; I don't think I've ever seen a show that seemed more transparently therapeutic.The narrative takes the form of a recollection by Jack Henry on the brink of his life's climax. He's in the locker room before the Super Bowl, in which he, as a defensive back, will oppose his older brother Charlie, who is, in the unrestrained parlance of the script, "the greatest quarterback of all time."Most of the tale concerns Jack's growing up in the shadow of the gifted and universally admired Charlie, suffering the unintended slights of his parents and trying to reconcile his anger with his own unrestrained love for his brother.As Jack, Mr. Eason recounts a lunatic obsession, a 20-year plan conceived at age 9 that will end with his playing in the Super Bowl, and carried out with feverish religiosity: the daily training sessions beginning at 5 a.m.; the entreating of friends, teachers and his brother to throw him pass after pass after pass ("1,000 balls a day"); the sublimation of adolescent sexuality; the defiance of medical logic; the recuperation from injury after injury.For the first two-thirds of the show, his wrists and fingers taped, wearing football pants and a sleeveless T-shirt, his knees and one shoulder prominently scarred from surgical repairs, Mr. Eason affects a childish aspect in his speech, an eager bleating that implicitly pleads for approbation. It's a storytelling strategy that clashes with his physicality, his obvious athleticism, his chiseled, not-quite-matinee-idol good looks and most of all the slightly crazed gleam in his eyes, as if he were hopped up on steroids. And in the spare, persuasive locker room set (kudos to Neil Patel), as he fiddles with a football and mimics throwing and catching, stiff-arming and juking, Mr. Eason builds a picture of a young man's psyche warped by his family.It is only when Jack dons his uniform -- helmet, shoulder pads and Houston Oilers jersey -- and game time is imminent that his aspect changes. An incantatory hauteur creeps into the language: "Now there's no chance of brotherhood. I will spill his blood. I will color the field red with his blood and drown him in it." And Jack himself becomes galvanized with faux Homeric anticipation.I won't divulge who wins the game, but at a climactic moment, Jack does indulge an Achillean wrath against his brother, which, as an act of battle strategy, makes about as much sense as Troy's acceptance of a gift horse. (Another false detail, although a minor one: Super Bowl crowds never count down the final seconds of a game; that's what happens at college games when the home team wins.)In the end, this willful shunning of authentic detail undermines the show's strength, which is Mr. Eason's insider's perspective on pro sport, a rarefied world that rarely makes it onto the stage. Instead, we're given a story that inflates itself, presumably to speak louder and be heard more easily, which is apparently something Mr. Eason couldn't do when he was growing up.RUNT OF THE LITTERWritten and performed by Bo Eason; directed by Larry Moss; set by Neil Patel; lighting by David Gipson; sound by Bruce Ellman; production stage manager, Anna Saggese; production manager, B.

She's a problem like Sarah Palin, Cyndi Lauper and Kathy Griffin. She's annoying. Or, really, she's double-annoying, because she styles herself as annoying -- provocative-annoying -- and if you become annoyed by her you seem to be conceding the point. She's gotten to you.    Take ''The Wordy Shipmates,'' her fifth book. Vowell has integrated her sarcasm, flat indie-girl affect and kitsch worship -- refined in print and on public radio -- into a pop history of the Massachusetts Bay Colony. Known for her adenoid-helium voice, Vowell is a genial talker but an undisciplined writer. This new book mixes jiggers of various weak liquors -- paraphrase, topical one-liners, blogger tics -- and ends up tasting kind of festive but bad, like Long Island iced tea.    ''The Wordy Shipmates'' also includes a few stand-up comedy routines, plainly written to be performed. Vowell delivered one good-natured but uninspired spiel (about sitcoms that address American history) for a ''This American Life'' stage show. It includes a string of asides about Richie, Potsy and the gang on ''Happy Days.'' It should not have been committed to print.   Vowell, who constantly emphasizes how nerdy (meaning impressive) she finds her own interest in the Puritans, introduces figures like John Winthrop and Roger Williams as if no one's ever heard of them. She delivers a farrago of free-floating pedantry -- ''the kind of smart-alecky diatribe for which I've gotten paid for 20 years'' -- having evidently made it her job to enlighten slacker Gen-Xers with a remedial history of our own nation.   It's not right. Vowell's whole alt-everything vibe is just dated enough to be cringey. And then there's her Great Plains accent: can something so wholesome-soundin' be real? And her politics. Perfectly early-millennium coastal (green, be good, Obama, etc.). Can she really take pleasure in plumping for an autofill ideology that's so widely shared?   Evidently she can. The book, which on one level is a chronological account of Winthrop's attempt to build an exemplary ''city upon a hill,'' hums along with chipper personal details and relaxed talk-show-guest banter. Vowell breaks from her breezy rehash of (mostly) the work of the historian Perry Miller to supply ''what's the deal with that'' perceptions about Ron Paul, historical re-enactors and magazine subscription cards. She sounds as if she's enjoying herself.   But what's the deal with the rehash? These days, we have sterling academic American historians (who can hardly be said to have overlooked the Puritans, in whose intellectual tradition the study of American history -- at Harvard, notably -- was originally conceived). But we are also in a golden age of popular narrative history, produced not only by David McCullough and Ron Chernow and Doris Kearns Goodwin, but by PBS and the History Channel. With all these middlebrow historians making scholarly work perfectly accessible, do we really need still more accessibility -- pierced-brow history, maybe, with TV and pop-music references?    The answer would seem to be no. And yet, if nothing else, ''The Wordy Shipmates'' finds a way to string together excerpts from Winthrop and Williams (and John Cotton and John Underhill) that keeps you reading. My experience of the book: I kept being annoyed, and I kept reading. Most of the time that she wasn't riffing or telling jokes, Vowell was merely quoting from a 17th-century sermon or pamphlet with the preface that what I was about to read was amazing or frightening.  More often than not, she was right.    Throughout, Vowell can't decide what tense to use: the historical present, the past, and that weird Ken Burns ''would'' thing (''Cotton Mather would change America forever''). But by book's end she's got you cornered. Just as you're thinking, O.K., the history of the Massachusetts Bay Colony is worth retelling, but could you turn down the hipster stuff, Vowell manages to align herself squarely with the great American dissident and feminist Anne Hutchinson. Rats! Once again, Vowell gets to be the abrasive wild card. She's annoying and uppity, and the book has made the case for being annoying and uppity. She's won.   Vowell may not be Anne Hutchinson (hey, did you know that Hutchinson had 15 children?), but she's a legitimate upstart. After all, having grown up a part-Cherokee Pentecostalist, she has somehow managed to become the one and only Sarah Vowell: a respected social commentator, a public radio star, the voice of Violet in ''The Incredibles'' and the author of five untrivial books, all while befriending (the tour-de-force acknowledgments section suggests) J. J. Abrams, Dave Eggers, Jake Gyllenhaal, Spike Jonze, Greil Marcus, David Sedaris and Zadie Smith.   How impressive. How annoying.URL: http://www.nytimes.comLOAD-DATE: November 30, 2008LANGUAGE: ENGLISHGRAPHIC: DRAWING (DRAWING BY DAVID HEATLEY)      DOCUMENT-TYPE: ReviewPUBLICATION-TYPE: NewspaperCopyright 2008 The New York Times Company18 of 50 DOCUMENTSThe New York TimesAugust 15, 2006 Tuesday  Late Edition - FinalPlayful Rock Experiments And Balkan Gypsy FlavorsBYLINE: By KELEFA SANNEHSECTION: Section E; Column 5; The Arts/Cultural Desk; MUSIC REVIEW; Pg. 1LENGTH: 620 wordsSunday's concert at the formerly abandoned McCarren Pool in Williamsburg offered spectacular new proof of a familiar old fact. Often broke but rarely poor, indie-rock fans are an intensely price-sensitive bunch.  The headliners were Beirut, the emerging brass-enhanced band led by the 20-year-old crooner Zach Condon, and Deerhoof, the long-running San Francisco band that recently lost a member to become a herky-jerky power trio. If tickets had been $20, hundreds of fans might have shown up. If tickets had been $10, a few thousand might have appeared. But since admission was free, the place was packed (though solicitors at the front gate made a paradoxical plea: they asked for donations to help keep these concerts free).The pool's official capacity is 5,500, which meant an almost comically large audience for a couple of cultish bands. McCarren Pool is a big, shallow, crumbling rectangle, and the familiar Williamsburg sights -- stubbly chins, flip-flopped feet, retro sunglasses -- seemed to stretch toward the horizon.    ''We would like to thank all of you for coming,'' said Greg Saunier, Deerhoof's drummer, and he sounded dazed and amused. ''Many thank you's.''  The free concerts at McCarren this summer are subsidized partly by ones that aren't (like the Sonic Youth and Yeah Yeah Yeahs doubleheaders this past Friday and Saturday). And when you haven't bought a ticket, you also haven't bought the right -- or maybe, in this city, the obligation -- to complain.  Deerhoof played last, after a rather perfunctory D.J. set by ?uestlove, the drummer for the hip-hop band the Roots. Although ''after'' isn't quite right: Deerhoof's set started before ?uestlove's set ended: Mr. Saunier locked into the beat coming from turntables, and the other members of Deerhoof played alongside ?uestlove before veering off into their own squally, propulsive, profoundly playful rock experiments.  While Deerhoof has evidently perfected its approach, Beirut still sounds like a work in progress, and in some sense that's a good thing. The first Beirut album, ''Gulag Orkestar'' (Ba Da Bing!), was released earlier this year, and it's not an album anyone could have been expecting. Mr. Condon, who grew up in New Mexico but now lives in Brooklyn, is evidently obsessed with Balkan Gypsy music. (In the album's liner notes, he thanks ''all Balkan brass bands.'') That explains the clattering arrangements, and maybe also the melancholy melodies.  On Sunday Mr. Condon appeared with a seven-piece band that supplied him with all the glockenspiel, accordion, violin, ukelele and trumpet he needed. (When he isn't singing, Mr. Condon sometimes plays trumpet too.) The set began with ''Scenic World''; the tinny keyboard ostinato from the album had become a bright violin figure. As Mr. Condon dolefully sang, ''When things don't feel right/ I lie down like a tired dog/ Licking his wounds in shame,'' both the vibrato and the self-pity were evidence of another, decidedly non-Balkan influence: Morrissey.  The whole set wasn't this engaging. Mr. Condon's Balkan obsession sometimes feels like a phase; to his credit, he seems like a songwriter who could steal artfully from a wide range of genres. (In fact, his previous obsessions include doo-wop and electronic pop.) There were a few times, too, when his ragtag band sounded downright ragged: the songs didn't always swing.  Still, this crowd got a lot more than it had paid for. And part of the fun was watching Mr. Condon figure out what to do with so many people watching him. ''This is definitely the first show of ours with a beachball,'' he said, as one bounced toward the stage. And then a mumbled, wordless, ambiguous, vaguely jubilant afterthought: ''Eeaarrgghh.''URL: http://www.nytimes.comLOAD-DATE: August 15, 2006LANGUAGE: ENGLISHGRAPHIC: Photo: Greg Saunier and Satomi Matsuzaki of Deerhoof at McCarren Pool.

But he said the effort to form a united front would continue.  Also today, the Palestinian finance minister, Salam Fayad, said he had formed a fund to oversee all money handled by the Palestinian Authority, in response to pressure on the leadership to clean up its finances. Central elements of the unity platform that has been debated in Gaza by 13 Palestinian factions were to have been an end to terror attacks inside Israel and a call for a Palestinian state alongside an Israeli state.But Israeli and Palestinian reports said Hamas, a militant Islamic movement, refused to abandon its call for a single Palestinian Islamic state, eliminating Israel. Spokesmen for Hamas and another radical group, Islamic Jihad, declared they would not quit attacks inside Israel.At the same time, Hamas has not publicly rejected the entire draft platform, which also calls for a united Palestinian leadership.The Palestinian Authority of Mr. Arafat has been under strong pressure from the United States and Israel, and from many Palestinians, to undertake extensive reforms and concrete steps against terrorism. Mr. Arafat evidently hoped that a unified stand by all Palestinian organizations against suicide bombings and for a two-state solution would satisfy some of the demands.But Mr. Shaath's statement confirmed indications that Hamas was not prepared to fall in line behind Mr. Arafat. Two senior Hamas leaders have been killed in Israeli raids in recent weeks, evidently hardening the group's stance.The Israeli strike against the Hamas leader in the Jenin area on Wednesday raised concerns when it emerged that the Israeli troops had sent a teenage neighbor to enter the house where the leader, Nasr Jarrar, was holed up, to pass on a demand that he surrender.The 19-year-old youth, Nidal Abu Mohsen, was shot dead approaching the house -- each side accused the other of shooting -- and the Israelis blasted the house, killing the Hamas leader in the rubble. The Israelis said he was preparing a major attack inside Israel.The Israeli Army did not deny using Mr. Abu Mohsen but insisted that using a Palestinian to bear a message was not the same as using human shields. During the Israeli raids into West Bank towns last spring, the army acknowledged using Palestinians as shields as they searched houses but then announced it was discontinuing the practice.B'Tselem, an organization that monitors human rights in the West Bank and Gaza, charged that "using civilians to enter homes is just as life-threatening as the practices the state discontinued."Ephraim Sneh, the transportation minister and a former general, told Israeli Army radio, "I'm not sure that this stands up to the test of the law, but there is the consideration that we have to prevent a large terror attack and it's clear which consideration wins in this situation."In Gaza, a spokesman for Hamas, Abdel Aziz Rantisi, said Mr. Jarrar's death "will not pass without strong punishment."Mr. Fayad, the finance minister, is one of the senior Palestinian leaders who have been holding talks with an Israeli team led by Foreign Minister Shimon Peres, in which a key subject has been the release of Palestinian funds blocked by Israel. Israel agreed on Wednesday to release another $14 million of an estimated $300 million in tax revenues that were collected by Israel on behalf of the Palestinian Authority.Mr. Peres and the Palestinians have also been discussing an Israeli proposal to restore full Palestinian control in Gaza, to see if the Palestinian Authority is prepared to take charge of security. The Palestinians, led by their chief negotiator, Saeb Erekat, have not rejected the idea, but have urged that at least one West Bank town be included to underscore that Gaza and the West Bank are "one entity," as Mr. Erekat said.Meanwhile, Palestinian security officials said Israeli soldiers shot and killed a 5-year-old boy in Khan Yunis in the Gaza Strip, according to The Associated Press. The Palestinian officials said the boy's grandfather and another Palestinian man were critically wounded.In a statement, the Israeli military said three Palestinians opened fire at soldiers and fled in a car. The soldiers fired back, wounding one of the men. The military said it knew nothing of a child who was hit.Israeli military officials also said soldiers shot and killed two armed Palestinians who were approaching the fence around Gaza with a bomb, The Associated Press reported. URL: http://www.nytimes.com LOAD-DATE: August 16, 2002  LANGUAGE: ENGLISH PUBLICATION-TYPE: NewspaperCopyright 2002 The New York Times Company20 of 50 DOCUMENTSThe New York TimesJanuary 11, 2013 Friday  Late Edition - FinalOne Screen, Two Points of ViewBYLINE: By KEN JOHNSONSECTION: Section C; Column 0; Movies, Performing Arts/Weekend Desk; ART REVIEW; Pg. 38LENGTH: 688 wordsIt would be hard to find another work of contemporary art that protests war with such soulful grace and understated wit as Meiro Koizumi's ''Defect in Vision'' (2011), the main attraction of a small show at the Museum of Modern Art. Projected in somewhat different versions on opposite sides of a single screen in lustrous black and white, Mr. Koizumi's 12-minute video meditates on the doomed, myth-saturated mind of Japan's warrior class in the last days of World War II.A man and his wife sit on the floor and dine at a low table in a small, old-world-style room. Setting aside a newspaper he has been perusing, the husband reports that a full-scale offensive against the Americans in Okinawa is soon to begin. ''Will kamikaze blow again?'' the wife inquires. (Kamikaze translates as ''divine wind.'')''It's time to show off some 'samurai spirit,' '' her husband boasts. Evidently he will be joining the attack, and he promises that on his return he will accompany her on a holiday trip to a place where they will bathe in hots springs, take long walks and have sake for lunch. ''It doesn't matter where you are,'' the wife wistfully observes, ''you are happy as long as you drink sake.''As they fumble with the food and drink on the table, you realize early on that both characters are blind, as are the actors themselves. The symbolism is glaringly obvious but poignant nevertheless, as their blindness allegorizes a deep-seated obliviousness to historical reality.As played out in Mr. Koizumi's video, the dialogue takes only a couple of minutes, but it repeats several times with variations of camera work -- changes of focus, points of view and so on -- happening on both sides of the screen. At one point in the film, production assistants enter the room and move things around while the conversation is going on, lending it all an oddly artificial feeling. Yet, with each repetition, the meaning and its attendant feelings deepen.At the end comes a hyperbolic climax: on one side of the screen we see a close-up of the man in a pilot's hat and goggles, evidently flying an open-cockpit plane and crying out over the roar of wind and engine noise, ''Chieko, I am sorry'' and ''Chieko, goodbye.''On the other side, the wife remains tearfully at the dining table. ''It doesn't matter where you are, you are happy as long as you drink sake,'' she repeats, and she pleads as she has in previous iterations, ''Please come back alive.''I can only imagine how this work must strike Japanese viewers. Mr. Koizumi, who lives in Yokohama, is just 36, but it feels as if he were tapping into a deep, multigenerational river of mourning. A museum wall text points out the relevance of the nuclear debacle in Fukushima, which happened in 2011 while Mr. Koizumi was making ''Defect in Vision.''Yet for this American, at least, the tragic bravado it projects is all too easy to relate to in light of wars the United States has engaged in, from Vietnam to Afghanistan. Suicidal blindness of this kind knows no national boundaries.Organized by Sarah Suzuki, an associate curator of prints and illustrated books at MoMA, the exhibition includes two earlier videos by Mr. Koizumi that are showing on flat screens. These, too, deal with grief but are leavened by humor in wonderfully imaginative ways.In ''Human Opera'' (2007), a video artist invites a man into a surrealistically funky studio to recount a tragic story from the man's life. As the guest talks, the artist subjects him, with an almost sadistic busyness, to various irritating and humiliating adjustments to his clothing and body meant to make the video more visually interesting. The final scene, a kind of shamanistic exorcism, is shocking, scary and hilarious.''My Voice Would Reach You'' (2009) is a quieter, more plaintive piece, in which a young man tries to communicate by cellphone and letter with his deceased beloved mother. There is an element of absurdist comedy, but as in Mr. Koizumi's other two works, surface cleverness floats on genuine depths of emotion.''Projects 99: Meiro Koizumi'' runs through May 6 at the Museum of Modern Art, (212) 708-9400, moma.org.URL: http://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/11/arts/design/projects-99-meiro-koizumi-at-museum-of-modern-art.htmlLOAD-DATE: January 11, 2013LANGUAGE: ENGLISHGRAPHIC: PHOTOS: Above and below, scenes from Meiro Koizumi's video installation ''Defect in Vision'' (2011), set during World War II.

OESTREICHSECTION: Section C; Column 0; The Arts/Cultural Desk; MUSIC REVIEW; Pg. 6LENGTH: 517 wordsIt was a major musical work written in the 1920s in St. Petersburg (Leningrad from 1924) with little hope of a future. Suddenly, some 90 years later and in the United States, it has a lively present. Maximilian Steinberg's ''Passion Week'' arrived in New York on Tuesday evening in a stunning performance by the Clarion Choir, conducted by Steven Fox at the Church of St. Jean Baptiste on the Upper East Side of Manhattan. Actually, it had semi-arrived in April, when Clarion gave a closed reading of it; that same month, Alexander Lingas and his Cappella Romana of Portland, Ore., gave the work what were said to be its first complete public performances, in Portland and Seattle.But why did it lie dormant so long?Steinberg (pronounced SHTAYN-berg), a composer and pedagogue born in what is now Vilnius, Lithuania, in 1883, converted to Russian Orthodoxy from Judaism to marry a daughter of his mentor, Rimsky-Korsakov, in 1908. Steinberg's conversion may initially have been one of convenience, but to judge from the conviction that ''Passion Week'' exudes, he internalized it completely.From 1921 to 1926, when most religious music was banned by the ruthless new Communist regime, Steinberg applied himself to the piece, his only known sacred work, at considerable risk to his career and even his life. It was evidently a deeply felt act of quiet defiance.''Passion Week'' -- written for a cappella choir, like all music for the Russian church, and based on ancient chants -- was published in Paris in 1927, evidently to little notice. (Though some modest performance, somewhere, could have taken place.)The work found its way into the hands of the influential composer and musicologist Igor Buketoff, whose father had immigrated to the United States early in the century. The best guess is that Shostakovich, whom Steinberg called his best pupil, delivered it to Buketoff at a 1957 dinner party in Philadelphia.Buketoff sought out performers adequate to the difficulties of the work, which sometimes separates the choir into 12 independent voices. But on his death in 2001, that chore fell to his daughter, Barbara Mouk, who is Clarion's publicist, and a niece.The work is a treasure. Steinberg's style, with its contrapuntal complexities and its enriched harmonies, is slightly advanced over that of Rachmaninoff, excerpts from whose ''Liturgy of St. John Chrysostom'' filled out the Clarion program in lovely fashion. But Steinberg also achieves some of his finest effects with utmost simplicity, as in the female trio that opens ''The Wise Thief.''The Clarion forces, who specialize in early music, have been expanding their range of late, and they did so decisively here. (With a little help: This music demands a deep rolling bass sound, and Clarion brought in a noted basso profundo from Michigan: Glenn Miller.) The solos were well delivered by Estel Gomez, soprano; Michael Steinberger, tenor; and Philip Cutlip, baritone.Happily, the Clarion version of the work is being recorded this week, as Cappella Romana's was in the spring. Truly, however belatedly, Steinberg's moment has arrived.URL: http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/30/arts/music/steinbergs-passion-week-by-clarion-choir.htmlLOAD-DATE: October 30, 2014LANGUAGE: ENGLISHGRAPHIC: PHOTO: The Clarion Choir  performing Maximilian Steinberg's ''Passion Week'' at the Church of St. Jean Baptiste.

[2]Even if the beverage industry were composed of the nicest people in the world, it will not stop marketing to children unless it's made to; indeed, these marketing efforts are within the rules of the game, however deadly they may be. The outcome of those rules and the marketing they allow is pandemic obesity and all the costs associated with it, which have been detailed enough elsewhere to pass over here.The goal of right-thinking people, then, is to change the rules and somehow make it more difficult for the marketers to do their job. This can be done by legislation, executive mandate or - in some places, like California - referendum. Legislation to impose a significant tax on soda - a penny or even two per ounce - has failed everywhere, though it's come close, especially in Philadelphia. After failing to pass legislation for a soda tax, Mayor Michael Bloomberg proposed (and will evidently institute, five months from now) a ban on large sizes of soda in many New York City places.Now the California cities of Richmond and El Montehave put the soda tax - which has been endorsed by the United Nations, the American Heart Association, the American Medical Association, The New England Journal of Medicine, the Institute of Medicine and many others, and which the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention commissioner, Thomas Frieden, has called"the single most effective measure to reverse the obesity epidemic" - on the Nov. 6 ballot.Both of these are working-class, largely nonwhite cities, with populations of about 100,000. Richmond [3] , ranked sixth-most-obese city in the state, is in the East Bay, north of Berkeley; El Monte - which ranks ninth - is just east of Los Angeles, in the I-10 corridor.[4] Were either to institute a soda tax, the prediction here is that some or even many nearby cities would follow suit quickly, for two reasons. The first, almost immediate, is that these nearly broke municipalities would each gain a new source of income that could, according to the soda tax calculatordeveloped by the economist Tatiana Andreyeva of the Rudd Center in New Haven, be about $3 million annually . [5]The cities must decide how to spend these small windfalls. Dr. Jeff Ritterman, a retired cardiologist serving on the Richmond City Council, says that "for $86,000 we can teach every third grader how to swim at one of our municipal pools, and for $800,000 we can put a nutrition-gardening-cooking instructor in each of our 10 elementary schools."The longer-term benefit, which may take a year, or three, or even five to become evident and accepted, is health. Studies have shown that reduced soda consumption results in reduced weight. How quickly and how significantly a soda tax would reduce consumption remains to be seen. But without this kind of intervention, says Ritterman, "Our adult obesity rate will go from 24 percent to 42 percent when the present fifth and seventh graders reach adulthood."There's a third reason other cities will follow suit, and that's reputation. As a local observer said to me, "You don't think San Francisco is going to be out-done by Richmond, do you?"For all of these reasons, the first city to institute a soda tax will gain historic relevance and begin a kind of domino effect that proponents of public health can get behind. But it's not going to happen without a struggle; remember, the beverage industry has no choice.And while the proponents of the tax are largely volunteers, public health proponents and well-intentioned politicians (not an oxymoron!), the beverage industry has the bucks, and is spending them at a rate of about 100 to 1, in Richmond, at least: according to Ritterman, as of last week the industry had spent $2.2 million getting out the "no" vote; supporters had raised $34,000 and spent $29,000. [6]Though Ritterman is optimistic ("We're going to win because truth and science are on our side"), El Monte's mayor, Andre Quintero, is more cautious: "The industry is spending very aggressively here: they have every single possible tool you can imagine having at their disposal." [7] El Monte, also, is a small city of less than 10 square miles, so businessmen argue that it's easy for their customers to leave to buy soda (or to eat, and order soda with a meal) in a neighboring town. "But," says Quintero, "even making that conscious decision - I'm going to step out of the boundary to get my sugary drinks - is going to work on the person and make them think, Is this a choice I really need to make?"That's the spirit: changing the rules to give people a reason to think, to consider, should change their behavior. The New York experiment may be effective, but most experts believe a tax is the way to go. Whether it's Richmond, El Monte, both, or someplace else, the first city to institute a soda tax will be the first domino to fall and eventually gain the gratitude of the rest of the country.1. I'll just call this "soda" from now on, but equally culpable are sugar-sweetened iced teas, so-called fruit juices, so-called sports drinks, so-called energy drinks, sweetened waters, coffee drinks with a calorie content like that of a banana split and anything else that has more sugar than you could ever imagine pouring into a cup of coffee. Just FYI, a 12-ounce soda contains up to 10 teaspoons of sugar; 12 ounces of Snapple is about the same; in fairness, Gatorade has "only" a little more than half as much sugar as that. A "tall" Frappuccino, by the way, contains 8 teaspoons of sugar.2.This isn't a matter of building safer cars and putting seat belts in them, or of engineering cell phones so they won't receive texts while you're driving (that'll happen). At some point a wildly popular and safe substitute for sugar may be found, but at some point a safe cigarette might be invented, or indeed a pill that will allow you to eat supersized cheeseburgers, fries and cokes twice a day, and not gain a pound. The winning ticket in those lotteries is worth billions if not trillions of dollars, and "they're" working on it, but "they're" working on energy from fusion, too.3. Home of Rosie the Riveter National Park!4. El Monte is one of those rare cities that actually has a municipal health and wellness plan, and it recently banned sodas from its park and recreation facilities.5. The same calculator tells us that a penny-per-ounce tax in Los Angeles would reap more than $113 million in its first year.6. A measure to force those working against the tax to disclose their funding sources was passed by the city council and successfully challenged by the industry.7.This includes referring to the soda tax as if it were a grocery tax, implying that soda = food, which it decidedly does not.

It was one of the bloodiest battles of World War I: It lasted almost ten months, and caused an estimated 300,000 fatalities. In March 1916, the European edition of The New York Herald published an eyewitness account of Verdun, written by the correspondent Herbert A. Gibbons. Here are a few excerpts:  VERDUN (by automobile to Paris) - This morning [Mar. 26] I stood on top of one of the forts that protect Verdun, and watched the puffs of smoke rising here, there and everywhere along the line of forts and hamlets, woods and crests and valleys, whose names have become familiar to all the world during the past five weeks. The area in which stupendous battles have been fought is quite small, and when one studies the map with the landscape actually before him he grasps clearly the fact that except at one point, the Germans have not broken into the actual ring of the city's defences. And at that point, where an opening was won at unparalleled cost, the attempts of the Germans to pass meet each time a cannon and mitrailleuse fire that literally annihilates. German Advance Futile The French have now established themselves once more on the old lines of Verdun defence, as they were before the outposts were advanced last spring. So, as far as breaking the line of defence of Verdun goes, the few kilometres gained by the Germans would not have much military significance, even if they had been won at a much less loss than is actually the case. The heroic French defence of their outer lines was not at all because those positions were essential. The outposts sacrificed themselves, holding back for days the best troops Germany could muster, in order to give the General Staff time to assure the impregnability or Verdun.Their heroism saved the day. Just as on the Marne in September, 1914, the French are now ready to say with confidence to the invader on the Meuse: "Your advance is ended; beyond this line you do not pass!" Teutons Evidently Abandon Hope The one and sole advantage gained by the Germans from their initial advance was to bring the city within range of their artillery.One walks today through a city absolutely deserted. But it is astonishing to note how little damage three or four hundred shells a day for a month were able to make. Evidently until three or four days ago the Germans still clung to their hope of capturing Verdun and spared the city as much as possible.From what one sees, it is certain that while they had hope they directed their bombardment - or tried to direct it - on places of military importance. But since Thursday morning they have been sending a constant hail of incendiary shells upon residence and business quarters. The Honor of France I had the novel experience of breakfasting today in an underground cellar (the only kind of a room where you are sure to be undisturbed these days!) with General X and his staff. The general put on the table as good a djeuner as you could get in Paris, and we talked of almost everything but Verdun. For there is no longer apprehension of the Germans taking the city.When events of the five past weeks were mentioned it was to extol the traditional courage and endurance of soldiers, who flinched not under the heaviest bombardments and the fiercest assaults to which human beings have ever been subjected. I listened to these stories gladly and gratefully: gladly because the honor of France is the honor of mankind; gratefully, because the safety of France is the safety of mankind.

And now that so many comedians have their own political talk shows, a similar bewilderment arises.      Is Dennis Miller really the wittiest, most astute comedian that CNBC could recruit? (Was Bill Maher the most insightful, clever talk show host HBO could find?)  For comedians and candidates alike, the answer is the same: of course not. Just as many of the country's most admirable leaders eschew the paltriness of modern politics, the most brilliant, captivating entertainers aspire to something other than a night-time cable talk show. (Jon Stewart, host of "The Daily Show" on Comedy Central, is the exception -- for now.) In that sense at least, Mr. Miller, whose hourlong talk show, "Dennis Miller," is shown Monday though Friday and on Sunday, is a little like the Democratic field he mocks so fiercely. He is not terrible, but his performance does make one wonder, somewhat wistfully, who else might be out there. It is of course unfortunate for any talk-show host to make a debut the week Jack Paar died. The black-and-white clips of that urbane, witty, if jittery "Tonight" show host that have been flooding television, especially NBC, could only work to the disadvantage of a comedian who opened his first show with a chimp in diapers crawling across his lap. (Mr. Miller said that the pet prop was a nod to J. Fred Muggs, Dave Garroway's furry alter ego on the old "Today" show, proving, if nothing else, that Mr. Miller is not pandering to youth.) Politicians left or right, too, face the hurdle of daunting comparisons when they declare their candidacies in the shadow of their parties' most beloved figures -- John F. Kennedy or Ronald Reagan. The analogy ends there, because politicians today are mostly attacked for lacking all conviction, while political talk-show hosts, particularly those with a background in stand-up comedy, are bursting with passionate intensity. Mr. Miller, a Sept. 11 convert to conservatism, evidently decided to contribute his comic talent to his latest cause. His main goal is not to amuse, and evidently, neither is it CNBC's. Like its sister cable news network, MSNBC, the business-oriented CNBC seems obsessed with outfoxing the Fox network, boosting its ratings by catering to conservative viewers who seek an alternative to what they regard as a widespread liberal conspiracy on television. Not surprisingly, Mr. Miller's highlights this week included a commentary by Bernard Goldberg, a disenchanted CBS producer, whose latest book, "Arrogance" (Warner, $26.95.), rails against the "liberal media elite," and David Horowitz, the editor of FrontPage magazine and a Los Angeles-based advocate for conservative causes. (Conservatives in Hollywood and New York always complain about stigma and persecution in the media and entertainment worlds, which makes one wonder why they don't get out more.) Mr. Miller campaigned for Arnold Schwarzenegger last fall, and was rewarded with an interview with the California governor on his maiden show on Monday. He turned their give-and-take into a gauzy infomercial for Mr. Schwarzenegger's new administration. When the governor praised his wife Maria Shriver's work as first lady, Mr. Miller replied, "I think that statements like that, your sincerity about, like, being a citizen -- a California citizen of the United States -- superseded your star quality." Mr. Miller, who is perhaps bestknown for his sneering asides as anchor of "Weekend Update" on NBC's "Saturday Night Live" in the mid-1980's, was being sincere, but viewers cannot be entirely blamed for thinking he was joking. The same was true the following night, when Mr. Miller interviewed another of his Republican heroes, Senator John McCain of Arizona, and asked him to address the wrongs done to Adm. James Stockdale, a former POW, who was mocked after floundering in a vice presidential debate in 1992. The uninitiated could be forgiven for thinking that Mr. Miller was joking when he called Stockdale jokes "one of the great injustices in contemporary American history." Mr. Miller, after all, spent much of Wednesday night gleefully squeezing a box on his desk, his Howard Dean "scream button." His goals for a show that zigzags from pious political preaching to one-liners and pranks were hard to decipher. And that may be why he laid out a mission statement in his opening monologue on Monday. "Your DTV dish runneth over," he told viewers. "In an increasingly polarized world, I believe you want someone to get incensed for you. As fringe groups on both sides tack further and further away from the mainstream, right versus left begins to look trivial. It's a far more dangerous world than ever before, and the focus is fast becoming right versus wrong. Simply put, we will do the news as catharsis."The catharsis he provides seems mainly tailored to his own demons as a recovering liberal. Mr. Miller has not been that liberal of late, however. In the 1990's, like the libertarian Mr. Maher, he became a champion of the endangered white male. (It was not affirmative action, however, that cost him his job as a commentator on ABC's "Monday Night Football" in 2002: the network dropped him to hire John Madden.) Sept. 11, he said, changed everything. Mr. Miller's guest on Wednesday was New York's former mayor, Rudolph W. Giuliani, and the two men chatted cozily about how well the administration is handling the war on terrorism. These somewhat bland, deferential interviews clash with Mr. Miller's impish sense of humor, which has a more snide, frat-boy flavor. (He drew a chuckle from Governor Schwarzenegger by saying that looking at illegal aliens trying to cross the California-Mexico border on any given night with a pair of night-vision goggles is "like the start of the Boston Marathon in ponchos."Mr. Miller makes less obvious cultural references as well. Mocking Gen. Wesley K. Clark's presidential aspirations, the comedian said the general was delusional and should go to "the inn with Bing Crosby and Danny Kaye," and sang, under his breath, "We'll follow the old man." Some viewers might not have caught right away that he was referring to a song about a retired general in the 1954 musical "White Christmas." Toward the end of each show, Mr. Miller moves to a table of panelists who debate hot issues of the day. Here, he is a more considerate host than Mr. Maher, who mostly uses his argumentative panelists as a backboard for his own one-liners. Mr. Miller was generous in letting Mr. Horowitz skirmish with ideological opponents like Naomi Wolf, the feminist and social critic, and Henry Louis Gates Jr., chairman of the African-American studies department at Harvard. Mostly, these exchanges are less like political debate than bar talk, and since people do not talk much in bars anymore but watch TV, even the thinnest arguments can be enlightening. Pooh-poohing Democratic accusations about the health risks of uninsured Americans, Mr. Miller, in Tuesday night's discussion, offered a rather startling "Let them eat cake" defense of the status quo. Referring to hospital emergency rooms, he assured Ms. Wolf that the uninsured actually do have a form of coverage. "Well, believe me, I've gone in without insurance," he said, "and they kind of take care of you."DENNIS MILLERCNBC, Mondays through Fridays and Sundays at 9 p.m., Eastern and Pacific times; 8, Central time.Dennis Miller, host and executive producer; Eddie Feldmann, senior producer and head writer.

Powell was joined by the foreign ministers of Britain, Italy and Japan on Friday in declaring that they would honor any request by Iraq's new government to withdraw foreign troops after June 30, when it is to receive limited sovereignty.  Speaking after a meeting of officials from leading industrial nations, Mr. Powell and his colleagues emphasized that they did not expect such a request to come. It inconceivable, they asserted, for anyone to doubt that a troop pullout would lead to chaos and violence in Iraq.  But the envoys evidently felt compelled to clarify the issue after some testimony in Congress on Thursday left the administration's intentions unclear. ''I have no doubt that the interim Iraqi government will welcome the continued presence and operation of coalition military forces,'' Mr. Powell said, adding that he was ''absolutely losing no sleep thinking that they might ask us to leave.'' But he said that, in the interest of clearing up any confusion, ''were this interim government to say to us, 'We really think we can handle this on our own; it would be better if you were to leave,' we would leave.'' Although few outside experts say they expect an Iraqi government to ask for a withdrawal of American and other allied forces, the issue has come up this week with the vehement anti-American reaction among Iraqis to the prison abuse scandal. At the House International Relations Committee hearing on Thursday, a top aide to Mr. Powell, Marc Grossman, was asked repeatedly what would happen if such feelings erupted after sovereignty is transferred. After resisting an answer, he finally said the United States would honor such a request. Mr. Grossman, under secretary of state for political affairs, was then contradicted by Lt. Gen. L. Walter Sharp, director of strategic plans for the military's joint staff, who said an Iraqi pullout request would not be valid unless it were made by an elected government due to take office next year. Mr. Powell and his colleagues were evidently ready for the question at their news conference at the State Department after a long day of meetings, including a brief session with President Bush at the White House. The foreign ministers of Italy, Britain and Japan chimed in endorsing Mr. Powell's answer. Despite the certainty of their responses, the determination of the envoys to set the record straight underscored the disarray and ambiguity right now in their plans for the future governance of Iraq. Mr. Powell and the other envoys said they were still discussing broad concepts for the wording of a United Nations Security Council resolution defining the new Iraqi government's security powers, as well as its control of oil revenues, the prison system and other matters. It was obvious from various public comments here and elsewhere that they had some distance to go to bridge their differences, which mainly focus on a demand by France, Russia and some others that the Iraqi government be given wide powers over its own affairs and that a multinational force be given a timetable to leave.  The United States is resisting making such provisions explicit, diplomats involved in the process say.  In New York on Friday, for example, Jean-Marc de la Sabliere, the French envoy to the United Nations, said a caretaker government should have the right to object to orders from American officers sending Iraqi soldiers into combat. ''Imagine the Iraqis being asked to go into Karbala or whatever place and not having the right to say no,'' Mr. de la Sabliere told reporters. ''It would be absurd to have the Iraqi armed forces engaged without the consent of the Iraqi government.''  In Washington, a senior administration official dismissed this demand as unnecessary, saying that it was self-evident that no one could order Iraqi troops to take an action against their will. ''Are we going to send them into battle at the point of a gun?'' this official said. Nevertheless, the French comment underscored an emerging theme in the discussions over a future Security Council resolution, with France and Russia once again taking the lead -- as they did in the months before the war -- in raising a challenge to the American approach. In this case, diplomats say there is hope of averting a clash. The Bush administration is planning for an Iraqi government to emerge in the next couple weeks from a selection process led by Lakhdar Brahimi, the United Nations envoy, who is in Baghdad with the task of bringing such a government full blown ''as from the brow of Zeus,'' as a State Department official commented recently. The foreign ministers conferring in Washington on Friday were also from Germany, Canada and the European Union. All were in town to prepare for the Group of 8 summit meeting of leading industrial nations on Sea Island, Ga., next month. As they struggled to narrow their differences on Iraq, the envoys said they were also trying to refine a planned appeal, the Greater Middle East Initiative, calling for democratic reforms in that region. An eight-page draft circulated this week among the envoys, but many were reported on Friday to have found it overly long and cumbersome.  Javier Solana, chief foreign affairs adviser to the European Union, said some progress had been made in shortening a document that, in its longer version, had been viewed by Arab leaders as imperialistic in tone. More important than whatever the Group of 8 does, he said, is what the Arab League decides in another week. ''After the declarations are all adopted, the important thing will be the implementation,'' Mr. Solana said. ''That will be the real test.''                URL: http://www.nytimes.comLOAD-DATE: May 15, 2004LANGUAGE: ENGLISHPUBLICATION-TYPE: NewspaperCopyright 2004 The New York Times Company26 of 50 DOCUMENTSThe New York TimesJuly 17, 2004 Saturday  Late Edition - FinalU.S. Is Readying Review For Detainees in CubaBYLINE: By NEIL A. LEWISSECTION: Section A; Column 1; National Desk; Pg. 10LENGTH: 1213 wordsDATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 16 Moving at what officials acknowledge is extraordinary speed, the Pentagon may begin special military hearings by the end of next week allowing prisoners held as unlawful combatants at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, to try to convince a board of officers that they are being wrongly detained. At the same time, law firms enlisted by civil liberties groups have been rushing to establish a different route of challenging the detentions, by filing court petitions. By next week, petitions may have been filed in federal court here on behalf of as many as a third of the detainees.  In effect, the two sides are engaged in a kind of undeclared legal battle to decide how the fate of the 594 detainees remaining in Cuba will be determined in light of a Supreme Court ruling issued last month. And both the Pentagon and the defense lawyers evidently believe that they need to move speedily to gain an advantage.  In their decision, the justices held that the federal judiciary's reach extended to Guantanamo Bay and that prisoners there must be allowed an opportunity to challenge their detention before a judge or other ''neutral decision-maker.''  The Defense Department responded last week with plans for hearings at Guantanamo before newly created Combatant Status Review Tribunals, which would qualify as neutral, the department said, since the officers serving on them would have no stake in the fate of a particular detainee. The civil liberties groups maintain that this solution has less to do with the Defense Department's intention to comply with the justices than with a determination to maintain control of the challenge process. The Pentagon evidently hopes that these hearings will be enough to persuade the courts not to intervene, say the critics, who as a result have added incentive to file their petitions as quickly as possible. Gordon R. England, the secretary of the Navy, who put together the Pentagon's plan, said at a press briefing Friday that the first hearing might take place late next week. He said officials hoped to get quickly to a point of moving 72 detainees a week through the process. ''We're confident that we will finish this, on the outside, in three to four months,'' Mr. England said, though he acknowledged that the procedures to be followed at the hearings were not yet complete. One military lawyer noted that the Pentagon usually moved in a more deliberate fashion; its plans for military commissions to try some detainees for war crimes were developed more than two years ago, for instance, and there has yet to be a commission proceeding. Of the new review process, the lawyer said, ''This is like moving at the speed of light for the military.'' Under procedures for the review, each detainee choosing to participate will meet with a military officer who will act as his representative, but not as his lawyer or other kind of advocate. The detainee will be given a document with an unclassified version of the accusations that were the basis on which he was deemed an unlawful combatant. With the help of his representative, the prisoner will then argue his case before one of three tribunals, each composed of three officers. Secretary England said the proceedings would be open to a small press contingent, although probably not in time for the earliest hearings. Several of the lawyers who have challenged the detentions were highly skeptical of the military's purpose in moving quickly on the hearings. Michael Ratner of the Center for Constitutional Rights, a New York group that helped bring the challenge leading to the Supreme Court's decision, said it appeared that the Pentagon was engaged in a last-ditch effort to retain control of the detainees by arguing that the military had provided a fair process and so persuading the courts not to take jurisdiction. ''Our theory here,'' Mr. Ratner said, ''is that we believe the Supreme Court decision gives the inmates the right to file habeas corpus petitions in federal courts.'' Joseph Margulies of the University of Chicago Law School, who argued the case for Mr. Ratner's organization before the Supreme Court, said the justices' decision required that detainees have an opportunity to contest their imprisonment under standards that are reviewable by federal courts for fairness. ''There is no way that these tribunals could meet that standard,'' Mr. Margulies said, citing several features of the plan, among them that the detainees will be represented not by advocates but by military officers with whom they will have no lawyer-client relationship. In the absence of a confidential relationship, any information a military representative obtained from a detainee could be shared with the tribunal. Secretary England said the proceedings were not supposed to be like trials.  ''This is a fact-based determination,'' he said. ''This isn't guilt or innocence. This is a look at facts. Here's a person: are they, are they not, an enemy combatant?''  But Mr. Margulies said he believed that the hearings were part of an effort by the Bush administration to ''keep Guantanamo an enclave outside the law.'' ''The entire process,'' he said, ''is a sham.'' Defense lawyers said they believed that in order to press their cases before the courts, they needed to be allowed to meet with their clients. Some have been promised that they will be able to meet them, but none have yet been given permission to do so. Thomas Wilner, a Washington lawyer who represents 13 detainees from Kuwait, said of the process, ''I hope they are not delaying this on purpose.'' Bryan Whitman, a Pentagon spokesman, said in an interview that there was no intention to delay lawyers' visits to Guantanamo. ''It's obviously not a place you can just fly to,'' Mr. Whitman said. ''We are working on the issues of clearances and logistics.'' Pentagon officials and the defense lawyers appear to agree that the hearings may well bring a significant reduction in Guantanamo's population. Asked what would happen when a tribunal deemed detainees not to be unlawful combatants, Mr. England replied, ''They go home.'' Mr. England said that in the last few days, officials had notified all the Guantanamo detainees of their right to a hearing. About 95 percent asked to participate and to see a representative, he said. The remaining 5 percent, he said, angrily rejected the process, some crumpling up and throwing away the information sheet telling them of it. The information sheet, which officials said had been translated for each of the detainees, also notified them of a right to challenge their detentions in federal courts as well. Mr. England said he did not know how many of the detainees inquired about that right when shown the notices. In another announcement related to detainees of the American military, the Pentagon said it was setting up an office to keep senior officials better informed of reports from the International Committee of the Red Cross. At Congressional hearings into abuses at Abu Ghraib prison near Baghdad, senior officers acknowledged that they had not responded properly to a Red Cross report about conditions there. Ryan Henry, the principal deputy under secretary of defense for policy, told reporters that the new Office of Detainee Affairs was being created as a ''correction vector.''URL: http://www.nytimes.comLOAD-DATE: July 17, 2004LANGUAGE: ENGLISHGRAPHIC: Photo: Gordon R.

LOCKWOOD. Jeffrey A. Lockwood, a professor of natural sciences and humanities at the University of Wyoming, is the author of ''Six-Legged Soldiers: Using Insects as Weapons of War.''SECTION: Section WK; Column 0; Editorial Desk; OP-ED CONTRIBUTOR; Pg. 12LENGTH: 619 wordsDATELINE: Laramie, Wyo.   INSECTS have been conscripted as weapons of war, tools of terrorism and instruments of torture for thousands of years. So should we be surprised by the news that the C.I.A. considered using these creatures to instill fear in Abu Zubaydah, a terrorist suspect?  Yes, and here's why.   The earliest hypothesized uses of insects in human conflicts involved bees and wasps. During the Upper Paleolithic period, nests of stinging insects -- evidently contained within baskets or pottery -- were heaved into rocky caves or thorny stockades to drive an enemy into the open. Employing insects to destroy crops or transmit disease would not develop until modern times (unless we include Yahweh's assaults on Pharaoh in Exodus). However, entomological torture continued to play a role throughout history.   The ancient Persians developed a gruesome practice called scaphism, which involved force-feeding a person milk and honey, lashing him to a boat or hollow tree trunk, and then allowing flies to infest the victim's anus and increasingly gangrenous flesh. Siberian tribes simply tied a naked prisoner to a tree and allowed mosquitoes and other biting flies to deliver as many as 9,000 bites per minute -- a rate sufficient to drain a person's blood by half in about two hours. And the stories of Apaches staking captives on anthills to ensure lingering and painful deaths are not merely the stuff of Hollywood westerns.  The epitome of insectan torture was developed by a 19th-century emir of Bukhara, in present-day Uzbekistan. He threw political enemies into a bug pit, a deep hole covered with an iron grille and stocked with sheep ticks and assassin bugs. The bite of the latter has been compared to being pierced with a hot needle, and the injected saliva digested the victims' tissues until, in the words of the emir's jailer, ''masses of their flesh had been gnawed off their bones.''   So what's surprising about the United States exploiting a prisoner's entomophobia? This appears to be the first case in which insects would have been used to inflict psychological terror. Solzhenitsyn described the use of bedbug-infested boxes in the Soviet gulags, but it seems that these were intended to cause physical suffering -- and the Central Intelligence Agency operatives evidently planned to use a physically harmless insect. (A caterpillar was mentioned.)   After having seemingly exhausted the nefarious uses of insects as unwitting agents in human conflict, the United States managed to find a new way -- 100,000 or so years after humans first inflicted pain on one another with bees and wasps -- to exploit the natural world as a means of creating suffering.  There are many arguments against torture. One is practical: If we torture others, they might torture us. This applies to psychological torture, too.   What if a terrorist group announced that their operatives had introduced Rift Valley fever into the United States? This mosquito-borne disease would make West Nile virus look like a case of the sniffles. Given that virtually every corner of America has a native species of mosquito capable of transmitting the virus, Rift Valley fever could spread across the nation. Hundreds of thousands of people could be sickened, with thousands dying and many more falling blind. The livestock industry could lose billions of dollars as animals aborted their fetuses and succumbed to bloody diarrhea.  Imagine the fear if every mosquito bite this summer could be the precursor of a disease that would cause your brain to become inflamed or your internal organs to hemorrhage?   The chances of this happening are slim. The terrorists might even be bluffing. But terrorism -- and torture -- can be psychological. URL: http://www.nytimes.comLOAD-DATE: April 19, 2009LANGUAGE: ENGLISHDOCUMENT-TYPE: Op-EdPUBLICATION-TYPE: NewspaperCopyright 2009 The New York Times Company28 of 50 DOCUMENTSThe New York TimesMay 3, 2005 Tuesday  Late Edition - FinalBeware of F.B.I. Agents Bearing Small Nail FilesBYLINE: By Joe Sharkey. On the Road appears each Tuesday. E-mail: jsharkey@nytimes.com.SECTION: Section C; Column 5; Business/Financial Desk; BUSINESS TRAVEL: ON THE ROAD; Pg. 7LENGTH: 877 wordsBusiness travelers love to share stories of adventures and misadventures. Last week's column, which was about what people routinely refer to as airport security hassles and what I call the T.S.A. Follies, brought some doozies. Here's a sampler from the e-mail messages and from follow-up telephone interviews: ''A friend who is an F.B.I. agent was permitted to carry her gun on board an airplane after showing proper identification,'' said Dr. Stephen J. Firestone from Minnesota. ''Her nail file, on the other hand, was confiscated because it could be used as a weapon.''   Then there is Barry David, an investment adviser from Tucson who travels domestically and internationally and served in the Navy's submarine service from 1956 to 1966. He wears a pacemaker and is routinely patted down at the airport checkpoint, but he says he gets indignant when he is treated like a suspect after the alarm goes off. ''Last summer, I was so disgusted with all the probing, squeezing, etc., that I showed up in very short shorts, a T-shirt top and flip-flops, with all my military decorations on the shirt just to make a statement,'' he said. (Yes, he had to remove the medals). The problem of women being invasively patted down and made to remove clothing at checkpoints has eased, but it evidently hasn't disappeared. Alexandra Mack, a workplace anthropologist from Connecticut, said she attended a business conference in Santa Fe, N.M., in early April and brought along her 6-month-old son. On the return trip, with infant in arms at the Albuquerque airport, she reports: ''I was dressed in slacks, a T-shirt and a long-sleeve cotton button-down. I was told to remove my long-sleeve shirt since it was outerwear. I saw no one else asked to remove similar articles of clothing. At that point, undressing was physically impossible while I was also holding a small child.'' Her demurral got her escorted to the secondary-search pen for a full body search. And, yes, the infant got the perp pat-down as well. ''We can all rest assured that the world is safe from baby terrorists,'' Ms. Mack said.  Speaking of terrorists, Milton Williams is evidently suspected of being one. A totally different Milton Williams, this one from Redding Center, Conn., reflects on this every time he arrives at an airport, and is treated like the elusive 20th hijacker because, he learned, he (and every other Milton or Milt Williams in the country) shares a name with a 20-year-old suspect on a terrorist watch list. ''I'm 84 years old,'' Mr. Williams pointed out. Chuck Elliott, a professional poet from the Los Angeles area, said he was inspired by last week's column to compose a new work. The title will suffice: ''What I Should Have Told That Airport 'Security' Man Who Looked at Every Card in My Wallet.''  Amy Alkon, also from the Los Angeles area, almost got her boyfriend busted on a business trip after she visited a flea market and bought a ''Barbie-like pair of toy scissors,'' which she absently tucked into his carry-on bag. ''They totally freaked at security,'' said Ms. Alkon, who writes a column, ''The Advice Goddess,'' syndicated in 100 newspapers. Now, Ms. Alkon says, she is ''totally paranoid'' going through security because ''I have such an imagination.'' ''I think they're going to identify my four-inch heels as a potential weapon. I also have a slim glass nail file that I got in France, and I'm always worried that they will confiscate it and I will be carted away in leg irons.'' Danielle Donovan, a mortgage broker from La Costa, Calif., said that at the Springfield, Mo., airport last year, she watched a guard order an elderly woman in a wheelchair to remove her shoes and ''every piece of outer wear, including her sweater.''  ''The poor lady was wheeled through the metal detector with her stocking feet dragging along the filthy floor,'' Ms. Donovan said. In another incident, Ms. Donovan said she declined to remove her shoes at a checkpoint last year, knowing they had no metal in them. Regulations say you are not required to remove shoes, but if they set off the metal detector, you'll get a secondary inspection. Most travelers, however, say they are routinely ordered to remove shoes. ''I found myself trailed to the gate by a plainclothes guy doing his best imitation of a surfer, except for his military posture and the earpiece wire poking out from his ski cap,'' she said. ''So I got up and moved to a food counter, just to see if I was being paranoid. Sure enough, he was pretty soon standing near me watching me eat my turkey sandwich.'' David Schraa, a frequent business flier who works in Washington, said that improving ''the incredibly shabby and inefficient physical arrangements for this depressing process'' would itself enhance security. Like Mr. Schraa, John Craver, a New York architect, suggested that the checkpoints are so badly designed that they resemble yard sales. They are ''nothing more than an ad-hoc collection of equipment and cheap folding tables,'' he said. They're right on that. Better layout and design would go a long way toward alleviating some of the confusion, if not all of the absurdity. Meanwhile, it's heartening to know that so many of you are packing that very important business-travel tool: a sense of humor.URL: http://www.nytimes.comLOAD-DATE: May 3, 2005LANGUAGE: ENGLISHGRAPHIC: Drawing (Drawing by Chris Gash)                                                                              PUBLICATION-TYPE: NewspaperCopyright 2005 The New York Times Company29 of 50 DOCUMENTSThe New York Times Blogs(ArtsBeat)March 3, 2015 Tuesday'House of Cards' Season 3 Episode 8 Recap: The Story of the HurricaneBYLINE: JEREMY W. PETERSSECTION: ARTSLENGTH: 781 wordsHIGHLIGHT: There are many things Frank can control. Weather is not one of them.  Season 3 Episode 8 Recap: Chapter 34 Hurricane Faith is bearing down on the East Coast. But she's met her match in Hurricane Frank. Frank, never one to put too much faith in anything but his own ability to persevere, is doubtful this hurricane is really as powerful as the forecasters say it is.He has to believe this, given that he depleted the FEMA fund to create all those "America Works" jobs. So now there's no money to get ready for the storm. He tries to get Congress to give him an emergency appropriation. But the new Senate majority leader (evidently Hector Mendoza is out; something about an ethics violation after not reporting some paid speeches as income - in reality, the actor Benito Martinez went over to ABC to co-star in "American Crime," which premieres this week) won't budge. Frank can't get the money unless he agrees not to spend another dime on America Works, which Congress wants to shut down. Frank is in a bind: scuttle his signature domestic program (and his raison d'tre for running for a second term) or protect the millions of Americans who are in harm's way because of Faith. On the campaign trail, Heather Dunbar is channeling her inner Elizabeth Warren, railing against corporate greed and calling for a minimum-wage increase. After she finishes her speech, she reaches Doug. He's at home in bed, creepily watching that camera feed, hoping he'll glimpse Rachel. Still, he manages to take a break for a minute from his stalking and cook up a plan for Heather. Invite Jackie in for a meeting. She does and presses Jackie to agree to join her in suspending their campaign until after the hurricane passes. Jackie is skeptical. So Heather appeals to whatever motherly instincts Jackie may possess. It works.Heather Dunbar mystifies me. We're supposed to believe that she's a strong candidate for president and Frank's biggest political threat. Yet other than hiring Doug, which of course was his idea and perhaps not what it appears, neither she nor her team has demonstrated much political smarts. Then we see what Doug is up to. I can't tell if this is misdirection on the writers' part or not, but it seems he's still trying to ingratiate himself into Frank's inner circle. He calls Seth and tells him about Jackie's meeting. Tell Frank who told you this, he implores. (Seth evidently does not; and when Remy goes in to talk to Frank about Jackie, it seems that Frank thinks Seth is the one who learned about the meeting on his own.)Freddie is back in the mix again. And we learn that his dishwasher job is in jeopardy. If Frank agrees to suspend America Works, Freddie won't have a job. Frank finds out that Freddie has been a beneficiary of America Works and calls him into the White House to offer him a job. Freddie bring his grandson, who Frank charms with visions of sitting behind his Oval Office desk - maybe he, too, can be president one day. Freddie knows, however, that America does not work. "That's never gonna happen," he tells the boy. "No boy, this place ain't for you and me. It's good to have dreams, just so long as they're not fantasies."His conscience now somewhat less clouded, Frank signs the emergency relief hurricane bill. America Works, for now, is on ice. And he suffers a double indignity after Faith makes a turn out to sea and will spare the East Coast. His conviction that the storm wouldn't hit land is true. But it's too late. He can't pull back on the bill he just signed that halts his signature program.Frank puts a happy face on this with Yates. He thinks he can use his capitulation as a show of integrity that will give him a reason to announce his candidacy in 2016. As his inspiration, he tells Yates to look out the window and points to Freddie, who's trimming hedges on the White House lawn.  A Few Words About Yates This can't end well. Yates and Frank are getting closer. But someone else has now has her sights set on Yates. Kate asks him to get a drink and tries to pump him for information. Remember how proud we were of her for showing how much integrity a tough-minded female reporter could have by not sleeping with her sources? Well, that's out the window. They go to bed together. Even poor Meecham has it out for the guy. He knows he's being replaced as the favored boy toy. So he snaps at Yates one night when he's leaving Frank after another one of their long, intimate conversations. Now Yates is caught between these two tenacious characters whose ambition shows no bounds. He never should have let his guard down with Kate. And he definitely shouldn't have told Frank his first novel was a lie. I'd be rooting for his survival. But I just don't see it happening when he's up against these two.LOAD-DATE: March 3, 2015LANGUAGE: ENGLISHDOCUMENT-TYPE: NewsPUBLICATION-TYPE: Web BlogCopyright 2015 The News York Times CompanyAll Rights Reserved30 of 50 DOCUMENTSThe New York TimesApril 17, 1999, Saturday, Late Edition - FinalCRISIS IN THE BALKANS: THE PRISONERS;Serb Officer, Captured By Rebels, Held by U.S.BYLINE: By STEVEN LEE MYERS SECTION: Section A; Page 9; Column 6; Foreign Desk LENGTH: 758 wordsDATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 16Albanian rebels in Kosovo have captured a Yugoslav Army officer and turned him over to Albania, which today turned him over to the United States Army in Albania's capital, the Pentagon announced tonight.The Pentagon immediately declared the officer a prisoner of war. Quick to draw a distinction with Yugoslavia's treatment of three American soldiers captured along Macedonia's border on March 31, officials here emphasized that the officer would be treated in accordance with the Geneva Convention.  The officer, a lieutenant whose name was not disclosed, was captured by fighters with the Kosovo Liberation Army near Junik, Kosovo, late Tuesday or early Wednesday, a statement by the Pentagon said. The rebels secreted the lieutenant across the border to Albania and turned him over to authorities there.Evidently eager to transfer him to NATO's jurisdiction, the Albanian Government quickly alerted American military officers, officials said.A United States Army helicopter flew to an undisclosed spot in remote northern Albania and returned the officer, evidently unharmed, to Tirana, the capital, where he remains in American custody, the statement said. At the nascent American base in Tirana, the officer was examined by a doctor and "found to be in good condition," the statement said. The Pentagon said arrangements had already been made with the International Committee of the Red Cross to visit him."In addition to the food, shelter and medical care being provided, religious counseling is being coordinated for him," the Pentagon said.The capture of a Yugoslav officer immediately raised the prospect of a prisoner exchange, though it is not clear whether any diplomatic channels exist for such discussions.The Pentagon's spokesman, Kenneth H. Bacon, said an exchange is a possibility but added that it is premature to discuss it. "The rules of the Geneva Convention are pretty clear," Mr. Bacon said. "He'll remain in our custody until the hostilities end. I don't think it's time to speculate about anything else."The three American soldiers have been held in Yugoslavia since their capture in still unclear circumstances along the Serbia-Macedonia border. The three -- Staff Sgt. Andrew A. Ramirez, 24, of Los Angeles; Staff Sgt. Christopher J. Stone, 25, of Smiths Creek, Mich., and Specialist Steven M. Gonzales, 21, of Huntsville, Tex. -- were among 350 American troops in Macedonia as part of a United Nations observer mission.Shortly after their capture, they were shown on Yugoslav television, evidently beaten and bruised. After initially threatening to submit them to a military trial, in violation of the Geneva Convention, the Yugoslav Government declared that it would treat them as prisoners of war.An effort to free them by the Acting President of Cyprus, Spyros Kyprianou, collapsed a week ago when President Slobodan Milosevic balked, citing the intensification of NATO's bombardment.The United States maintains that the three were illegally seized by Yugoslav forces inside Macedonia, though American officials concede that they do not yet know all the circumstances of their disappearance.Pentagon officials said the captured officer, who was born in 1978, commanded a unit of about 20 men. His unit -- identified in Serbo-Croatian as the First Platoon, Second Battalion -- was part of a larger force conducting operations near Junik, in a valley that has been the scene of intense fighting throughout the yearlong separatist insurgency.The officials said the Yugoslav force included 300 army troops and 100 paramilitary police. It was not clear how the Kosovar rebels managed to separate the lieutenant from his platoon.The officials said it is likely he will be transferred out of Albania as soon as Saturday, possibly to Italy. In a potentially awkward legal complication, the Geneva Convention requires nations to provide protections for prisoners, but makes no explicit allowance for alliances like NATO, one official said.The Pentagon's statement said the prisoner would have the right to send and receive mail and "communicate any complaints" to his captors.NATO and the Clinton Administration have stepped up their praise of the Kosovo Liberation Army, an organization harshly criticized by the State Department only several months ago as "terrorist.""Like a phoenix which rises from the ashes, the Kosovo Liberation Army is able to mount a number of attacks still inside Kosovo," NATO's spokesman, Jamie P. Shea, said today before the capture was announced.  http://www.nytimes.comLOAD-DATE: April 17, 1999LANGUAGE: ENGLISHCopyright 1999 The New York Times Company31 of 50 DOCUMENTSThe New York Times Blogs(ArtsBeat)July 21, 2007 SaturdayLondon Theater Journal: Just Like Home, Except for the Prices and the MusicalsBYLINE: BEN BRANTLEYSECTION: ARTSLENGTH: 391 wordsHIGHLIGHT: London Theater Journal: Being in Britain is often just like being in America, Starbucks and all, but there are differences, from the prices to the local taste in musicals. LONDON, July 21 - Now where am I again? Thanks to the corporate homogenizing of the Western world, a New Yorker can visit London and pretend he never left home (as long as he ignores the price tags). He can drink coffee at Starbucks, buy a sweater at the Gap and spend his Friday night, as I did, seated beside American tourists, watching a reasonable facsimile of a show he saw recently on Broadway. This one was "The Drowsy Chaperone" (though it could have been "Wicked" or "Spamalot"), the musical about a middle-aged show queen who imagines a 1928 musical into being while listening to its cast recording. The production has lost its greatest asset in Bob Martin, one of its creators, who originated the role (here and on Broadway) of the droll narrator. (His hard-working replacement, Steve Pemberton, shows the strain of having to be that cultural contradiction, a witty American,  for nearly two hours.)Otherwise it's pretty much what it was in New York, except pushier, which seems unnecessary in a show with such a large built-in pushiness factor. Its big selling point here is the actress who plays the title character, which is really a supporting role. That's the diminutive Elaine Paige (the West End's original Evita and one of its few homegrown musical-comedy stars), who in a dark wig and tarantula eyelashes resembles a plush toy version of Joan Collins.Ms. Paige parodies her own pint-size-powerhouse style with likable gusto. But that's evidently not enough to satisfy British audiences, whose basic notion of what a musical is, as the critic Matt Wolf points out, is pretty close to the show being parodied here. (And if that's the case, I guess the argument goes, why put quotation marks around it?) Still running in New York after more than a year, "The Drowsy Chaperone" closes at the Novello Theater on August 4. It opened less than two months earlier. Mr. Pemberton's character makes a joke in his opening monologue about how the musical-within-the-musical didn't do well in London in 1928, as was often the case with Broadway shows that transferred to the West End. He paused and breathed in the silence on Friday night, before adding, "It's still true today." The line was greeted with scattered chuckles of commiseration. Evidently a shared taste in Starbucks doesn't automatically translate into a shared taste for theater.LOAD-DATE: April 29, 2016LANGUAGE: ENGLISHDOCUMENT-TYPE: NewsPUBLICATION-TYPE: Web BlogCopyright 2007 The News York Times CompanyAll Rights Reserved32 of 50 DOCUMENTSThe New York TimesJune 5, 2008 Thursday  Late Edition - FinalStep Right Up: A Playful, Complex Whirl, According to TharpBYLINE: By ALASTAIR MACAULAYSECTION: Section E; Column 0; The Arts/Cultural Desk; DANCE REVIEW; Pg. 5LENGTH: 1039 wordsWhile I was watching Tuesday night's world premiere of ''Rabbit and Rogue,'' Twyla Tharp's new work for American Ballet Theater, I was unaware of any particular audience excitement. Almost the reverse: though the dancers performed some spectacular feats, seldom could you hear any of the responsive noises usually elicited by the company's virtuoso stunts. An ovation, however, ensued. And you could tell by what some in the audience were saying on the way out -- wonderful, exciting, surprising, beautiful -- that many people sincerely admired it.  I honestly wish I knew why. There were moments when the lack of ''wow'' seemed part of the work's point, as Ethan Stiefel and Herman Cornejo, its two lead men, made complex jumps and spins look so casual as to be unremarkable. Such moments, however, did not endure or cohere.   ''Rabbit and Rogue'' -- choreographed to a commissioned score by Danny Elfman, with lighting by Brad Fields and costumes by Norma Kamali -- tries (I think) to blend the comic and the profound. Imagine the Marx Brothers amid a study in bustling urban classicism that seems caught between heaven and hell, or convention and transcendence. Ms. Tharp's program titles tell us that Mr. Stiefel plays Rogue, that Mr. Cornejo plays Rabbit, that there are a Rag Couple (Gillian Murphy, David Hallberg) and a Gamelan Couple (Paloma Herrera, Gennadi Saveliev), a Quartet, an Ensemble. Before the curtain rose, some of us wondered aloud whether ''Rabbit'' referred to John Updike. During and after the ballet, however, I neither knew nor cared.  I could find kind things to say of ''Rabbit and Rogue,'' but my heart wouldn't be in them. Of the labels that come to mind -- all-dance, eclectic, incoherent, overambitious, irksomely orchestrated, overamplified -- the one that applies most consistently is ''relentless.'' Mr. Elfman's score does provide several passages of hushed, low-key suspense or rest, but Ms. Tharp brushes them all aside.   To one such piece of quiet music she rushes on a quartet of dancers and at once has the two women step spectacularly onto the thighs of the two men and each extend a leg up, back, and high into arabesque penchee. It says much about ''Rabbit and Rogue'' that this image is merely incidental, a fill-in.   People keep coming and going here. The nonstop driven pressure -- with strong hints of occasional panic -- is the stuff of farce. But whereas a good farce requires us to care about what's at stake, ''Rabbit and Rogue'' never once suggests that Ms. Tharp feels any affection or admiration for her characters. Evidently she appreciates her dancers as brilliant instruments; evidently she intends her two star men as lively clowns. Yet the world she creates is both heartless and pointless.   Visually ''Rabbit and Rogue'' moves from dark to light. The first characters -- notably Rabbit and Rogue -- are dressed in black against a black backdrop; it takes all of Mr. Fields's lighting skill to make them visible. The mood is big city, with flashes of madcap mischief, craziness and devilry on the part of Rabbit and (especially) Rogue; the Rag Couple, sometimes ballroomy, have notes of tension and dispute. Later, however, characters dressed in white, silver and pale gray join the proceedings, the light changes, and the choreography occasionally starts to suggest that we're entering a new plane of liquefaction. The Gamelan Couple in these episodes seem expansive, fluent. If you've seen Ms. Tharp's ''Catherine Wheel,'' you can't help wondering if here she's trying to approach the transcendence of that work's concluding Golden Section.   Mr. Elfman's ambitious score has many hues -- including those of the gamelan -- and makes plain that he means here to step outside his achievements as a composer of film and television music. I hear echoes of Philip Glass (especially the pounding bass of ''In the Upper Room''), of the churning and brightly scored worlds of John Adams, and of the brilliant writing for high strings of Benjamin Britten. (One figure that closely resembles Britten's ''Young Person's Guide to the Orchestra'' keeps returning to irritating effect.) With many effects of coarse orchestration, however, it's a score that lacks distinction.  The differences in ''Rogue and Rabbit''  -- between black and white, metropolitan antics and otherworldly spaciousness, rag and gamelan, comic and sublime --  aren't easy to feel and aren't of much consequence.   It follows, in a remarkably short double bill, Harald Lander's ghastly ''Etudes.'' Since ''Etudes'' is just a sensationalist display of ballet style and technique at their most superficial, it's easy to say that it's best done brilliantly. (When the Kirov danced it at City Center in April, Leonid Sarafanov threw off eight double air turns in unpausing succession.) Actually ''Etudes'' is appalling no matter who's dancing however well. The score, Knudaage Riisager's orchestration of Czerny etudes, is a kind of ''Young Person's Guide to Hating the Orchestra''; the structure and arrangement of dances is inane. It's much more enjoyable when it's danced atrociously, the way I used to see it 30 years ago with the London Festival Ballet. (When the dancers jumped in grand jete, their legs would flash out into the splits, and yet their torsos would descend.) Brief moments of Ballet Theater's ''Etudes'' were fun in this horrid way. But watching the often admirable Sascha Radetsky forcing himself rigidly through this twaddle made me miserable.   I sat there thinking, ''At least we're going to see a ballet by Twyla Tharp to compensate for this horror.'' Then ''Rabbit and Rogue'' turned out to be far more like ''Etudes'' than I could have anticipated: choreographically flashy, aurally odious, structurally baffling, expressively empty. Doubtless it has merits to which I am not doing justice; I write before seeing a second cast. Certainly it is the most innovative item in the otherwise wretchedly and timidly reactionary repertory offered by Ballet Theater this season, and for that reason my disappointment is all the more pronounced.   ''Etudes'' and ''Rabbit and Rogue'' will be performed through Saturday at the Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center; (212) 362-6000, metopera.org.  URL: http://www.nytimes.comLOAD-DATE: June 5, 2008LANGUAGE: ENGLISHGRAPHIC: PHOTO: Rabbit and Rogue: Herman Cornejo foreground, performing in Twyla Tharp's new work for American Ballet Theater on Tuesday night.(PHOTOGRAPH BY ANDREA MOHIN/THE NEW YORK TIMES)                                                                         DOCUMENT-TYPE: ReviewPUBLICATION-TYPE: NewspaperCopyright 2008 The New York Times Company33 of 50 DOCUMENTSThe New York TimesOctober 5, 1997, Sunday, Late Edition - FinalJordan Expecting Israel to Release More Palestinians From JailBYLINE: By SERGE SCHMEMANNSECTION: Section 1; Page 15; Column 1; Foreign DeskLENGTH: 568 wordsDATELINE: JERUSALEM, Oct. 4Jordanian officials indicated today that they expected more Palestinians to be released from Israeli prisons in the burgeoning aftermath of a reported Israeli cloak-and-dagger operation in Jordan that went badly awry.Samir Mutawe, a Jordanian state minister for information, was quoted as saying, "We have information to believe that some Palestinian prisoners will be released soon." The Associated Press quoted other Jordanian officials as saying that the prisoners would include several leaders of the Islamic movement Hamas, and that they would be released to the West Bank and Gaza.  The reports followed the release on Wednesday of Sheik Ahmed Yassin, the spiritual leader of Hamas, in what Jordanian and Israeli press accounts claimed was a deal to placate King Hussein for a botched attempt by two Israeli agents on the life of the political leader of Hamas abroad, Khalid Meshal, in Amman, the Jordanian capital.There was still no public comment on the affair from the Irsaeli Government, which has in effect been in seclusion since Wednesday because of the Jewish New Year and the Sabbath. But there were extensive indications that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was bracing for a major political and security crisis when the Government meets on Sunday and when newspapers here resume publication.There were reports that Mr. Netanyahu met with newspaper editors today, evidently to urge restraint in covering the affair.The combination of a purportedly botched Mossad operation and the release of a senior Hamas leader comes at the very time when Mr. Netanyahu is putting intensive pressure on the Palestinian Authority to crack down on the movement.Publicly, King Hussein has denied that he had made any deal with Israel for the release of Sheik Yassin. But reports of a link between the release and the attempted assassination filled the Jordanian press and Israeli television reports.One major question in Jerusalem has been why Mr. Netanyahu would approve so risky a secret operation -- if indeed he did -- in the capital of Israel's best, and perhaps only, remaining friend in the Arab world.Israeli television, evidently drawing on information from sources in the Government, said today that the decision to attack Mr. Meshal had been made because he was purportedly involved in ordering suicide attacks inside Israel.For Mr. Netanyahu to release more Hamas officials, after already setting Sheik Yassin and Mr. Abu Marzook free, would undermine his repeated charge that the Palestinian leader, Yasir Arafat, was failing to keep Hamas militants in jail, and would be certain to draw fire from both the Israeli left and right.But if Jordan was indeed holding two Mossad agents, it was evidently Israel's priority to obtain their release. Mr. Mashal's assailants, who were arrested carrying Canadian passports, were reportedly still in a Jordanian jail.The presumption that the attackers were Israeli agents was strengthened by Canada's angry reaction to the disclosure that Canadian passports were used in the operation. The Canadian Ambassador to Israel, David Berger, left Tel Aviv today after being summoned to Ottawa in what the Canadian Foreign Ministry described as a "fairly serious step."The Canadian Foreign Minister, Lloyd Axworthy, said, "Our own evidence, which we have developed, suggests that there was Israeli involvement in this issue."LOAD-DATE: October 5, 1997LANGUAGE: ENGLISHCopyright 1997 The New York Times Company34 of 50 DOCUMENTSThe New York TimesOctober 5, 1997, Sunday, Late Edition - FinalJordan Expecting Israel to Release More Palestinians From JailBYLINE: By SERGE SCHMEMANN  By SERGE SCHMEMANNSECTION: Section 1; Page 15; Column 1; Foreign DeskSection 1;Page 15;Column 1;Foreign DeskLENGTH: 568 wordsDATELINE: JERUSALEM, Oct. 4Jordanian officials indicated today that they expected more Palestinians to be released from Israeli prisons in the burgeoning aftermath of a reported Israeli cloak-and-dagger operation in Jordan that went badly awry.Samir Mutawe, a Jordanian state minister for information, was quoted as saying, "We have information to believe that some Palestinian prisoners will be released soon."

The S.E.C. also declines to comment.  For shareholders, who have seen the value of their shares plummet, there seems to be little to do but wait for the outcome, and hope the stock price will rebound. In the meantime, it may serve as an object lesson regarding the risks of buying stocks at huge multiples of book value.AMRE shares plunged $2 a share on Friday, when the company said it would restate its financial statements for periods before April 30, 1989, and dropped an additional 50 cents, to $3.25, yesterday in New York Stock Exchange trading. Back in 1988, when the financial results now called incorrect were being issued, the shares traded for more than $15 a share, or more than eight times tangible book value.AMRE, whose largest business is installing vinyl siding on homes, usually as a contractor for Sears stores, evidently did not foresee the market reaction. Mac M. Martirossian, the company's chief financial officer, said AMRE has been repurchasing shares for more than six months, and made its last purchase on Jan. 3 or 4, paying "in the $5 range."In announcing the retraction of its financial statements for 1988 and early 1989, the company said it still believed subsequent financial statements were accurate, although new outside accountants, from Ernst & Young, are only now being brought in to review the books. The old statements were certified by Price Waterhouse, which remains AMRE's auditor.According to the latest financial statements, the company earned 52 cents a share for the first six months of the 1991 fiscal year, through last Oct. 31. Mr. Martirossian said analysts had estimated annual profits of 60 to 70 cents a share. If the lower estimate is reasonable, and Mr. Martirossian would not comment on that, the company is now trading at a low 5.4 times profits.That makes the stock sound cheap, but the shares remain well above the company's tangible net book value, of $1.89 a share. And it is far from clear just what else will be disclosed before the investigation is completed, or how the company, formerly known as American Remodeling, will fare with two of its top officers having lost their posts, but evidently continuing to collect large salaries.The company's announcement on Friday said that Steve Bedowitz had stepped down as chairman, president and chief executive, but would stay on as a director and employee. Mr. Martirossian said that his principal duty would be to help his successor, Ronald I. Wagner, who had run the company's kitchen cabinet division, but that Mr. Bedowitz would continue to collect the minimum $384,000 annual salary guaranteed in his contract through April 30, 1993.Ronald Levin, who resigned as chief operating officer and who served as chief financial officer during the period when the inaccurate financial statements were filed, has a similar contract, Mr. Martirossian noted.The S.E.C. investigation, according to disclosures by the company, dealt with its policies of recognizing revenues, as well as undisclosed other matters. The revenue recognition question evidently dealt with the company's unusual use of the "percentage of completion" method of recognizing revenues. Under that method, the company booked revenues as it did the work, although homeowners were not billed until the job was finished. The revenues on such contracts showed up as "unbilled revenues" on the balance sheet.That method is more often used for large military contractors, and as of April 30, 1989, the company switched to the completed contract method, in which revenues are recognized only after the contract is completed.What seemed odd about that, in late 1988, was that the company had unbilled revenues that equaled 20 days of total revenues, although the company said that the average contract took 4 to 10 days to complete. When questioned at the time, a company spokesman declined to discuss the issue in detail.Now, investors who bought shares while relying on the reports of rapidly rising profits have big losses, but they still do not know exactly what profit figures were correct. Mr. Bedowitz and Mr. Levin, the top officials when those figures were reported, have lost their top jobs but evidently will continue to get large salaries for more than two years.LOAD-DATE: January 15, 1991LANGUAGE: ENGLISHGRAPHIC: Chart: "Tracking AMRE" shows AMRE Inc.'s weekly close on the New York Stock Exchange.

HOBERMANSECTION: Section AR; Column 0; Arts and Leisure Desk; VIDEO; Pg. 12LENGTH: 1347 wordsNo filmmaker more fully embodies the history of movies, at least until the mid-1960s, than Fritz Lang (1890-1976). Born in Vienna, Lang was the most commanding figure in German silent cinema. There is scarcely a popular genre -- including science fiction, period spectacle, espionage, gangster and horror -- that did not pass through his hands and does not bear his mark. ''M'' (1931), his first talkie and official masterpiece, is the original portrait of a serial killer; once in Hollywood, he created the prototype for ''Bonnie and Clyde,'' and pioneered film noir.Lang also directed four anti-Nazi thrillers: one before the United States entered World War II, a pair during the war and the last just after the war ended. Two of these are newly available on Blu-ray: ''Hangmen Also Die!'' (1943), from Cohen Media, and ''Man Hunt'' (1941), from Twilight Time. Few Hollywood directors had so focused an interest in Nazism, but as a German migr with a heavy accent and imposing monocle, known for having directed movies admired by Hitler and Goebbels, Lang had something to prove. Even before the release of his first American movie, ''Fury'' (1936), in which Spencer Tracy barely escapes a lynch mob, Lang helped found the Hollywood Anti-Nazi League, bonding with Otto Katz, the suave Czech-born Comintern agent sent to America to mobilize the movie industry against Hitler. Already under F.B.I. suspicion as a German national, Lang would be even more closely watched for his associations. Like his fellow refugees and friends Bertolt Brecht, Hanns Eisler, Thomas Mann and Erich Remarque, he was what the F.B.I. considered a ''commu-nazi'' -- to use a description employed in bureau memos.''Hangmen Also Die!'' was of special interest to the F.B.I.'s director, J. Edgar Hoover, particularly since it was partially written by Brecht and scored by Eisler. The movie is both the most ambitious and most topical of Lang's anti-Nazi films. Sitting by the Pacific (according to Brecht), the writer and director began planning a movie prompted by the assassination of Czechoslovakia's fearsome Nazi overlord, Reinhard Heydrich, even before Heydrich died of his wounds and Hitler exacted revenge by massacring the adult male inhabitants of two Czech towns, Lidice and Lezaky and deporting the women and children to concentration camps.The killing of Heydrich and the reprisals it brought about galvanized American public opinion. Towns were renamed Lidice. Edna St. Vincent Millay was one of many who wrote poems on the atrocities, and another movie, ''Hitler's Madman,'' directed by another migr from Germany, Douglas Sirk, went into production.Brecht evidently intended to use the incident to celebrate proletarian solidarity and popular resistance to Nazi occupation. Traces remain in the scenes where members of the partisan cell responsible for dispatching Heydrich discuss their thinking, and particularly in the composition of the heroic anthem by a humble worker. Brecht also evidently wrote a scene dramatizing the specific persecution of Czech Jews that was excised by Lang (although you can glimpse a character wearing the mandated Jewish star), as was another that criticized anti-Semitism among the partisans.Lang, who had something more lurid in mind, brought on a second writer, John Wexley, also a Communist, to revise Brecht's script (and purloin his primary credit). The openly gay actor Hans von Twardowski (another migr, the second victim in ''The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari'') was cast as the briefly seen Heydrich, mincing, smirking, wearing lipstick and screaming in both senses of the word.Much of the movie concerns the education of a meek Czech maiden, Mascha Novotny (Anna Lee), who happens to see Heydrich's killer (Brian Donlevy) making his escape and must pretend to be his lover. Mascha is repeatedly summoned to Gestapo headquarters to be interrogated by the resident sinister buffoon (Alexander Granach, the vampire's cat's-paw in the original ''Nosferatu'') and, according to Lang's biographer Patrick McGilligan, she was bullied by her director as well.Visually, ''Hangmen'' is pure Lang -- shadowy, sharply angled and claustrophobic. Langian, too, is the sense of amused pity, as the Czech traitor (ripely played by the inappropriately comic Gene Lockhart, soon to appear as Molotov in ''Mission to Moscow'') is trapped and run to earth. Brecht may not have been responsible, but the movie has touches that a contemporary audience might recognize as Brechtian. That news of Heydrich's death is delivered to the audience in a Prague movie house presages a melodramatic plot that is blatantly dependent on subterfuge, disguise, playacting and the fabrication of alternate stories.Lang got to direct his first anti-Nazi film, ''Man Hunt,'' adapted by Dudley Nichols from a best-selling thriller, mainly because John Ford turned it down. Ford, however, could not possibly have brought more conviction than Lang to the fanciful tale of a British sportsman (Walter Pidgeon) who, having bagged every big game animal in Africa, takes a mind to stalk Hitler -- without actually firing -- just for the heck of it.A sensation upon initial viewings in June 1941 (only days before Germany invaded Russia), the movie has a long, silent opening scene, with the Nazi leader in his Berchtesgaden hideaway framed in the sniper's gun sight, that still packs a wallop. The rest of the movie, in which a monocle-wearing Gestapo mastermind (George Sanders), who also happens to be a big-game hunter, pursues Pidgeon back to London, is beautifully lit, expertly directed and considerably enlivened by the presence of Joan Bennett, obviously enjoying herself in the role of the teenage cockney quasi-prostitute who comes to Pidgeon's aid. Her martyrdom is a sacrifice, on the altar of freedom and to the requirements of the Production Code.NEWLY RELEASEDBURNING BUSH Working for HBO Europe, the Polish director Agnieszka Holland made a hectic, bruising four-hour mini-series about the martyrdom of Jan Palach, a student who set himself aflame to protest the Soviet invasion and occupation of Czechoslovakia. ''The film does a remarkably persuasive job of capturing the nightmarish and sometimes grimly comical quality of life under totalitarianism,'' A. O. Scott wrote in The New York Times in June. (Kino Lorber)FHRER CULT AND MEGALOMANIA A documentarian who has worked extensively with German archival footage, Michael Kloft has conducted a fascinating excavation of Nazi Nuremberg, the medieval city selected by Hitler to be a Third Reich shrine, the site of grandiose constructions and party rallies, most infamously memorialized in Leni Riefenstahl's ''Triumph of the Will.'' (First Run)IDA Set in the early 1960s, Pawel Pawlikowski's adroit, subtle and sensitive account of a teenage novice who discovers that she was born a Jew, is like a Polish film from that period that could not have been made then. ''Mr. Pawlikowski has made one of the finest European films (and one of most insightful films about Europe, past and present) in recent memory,'' Mr. Scott wrote in The Times in May. (Music Box)THE DESERT SONG Warner Bros.' 1943 Technicolor version of the Sigmund Romberg operetta, directed by the French-born filmmaker Robert Florey, was not only updated with an anti-Nazi premise but also, more surprisingly, has a marked anticolonial angle. ''This picture is not flattering to the prewar French military caste,'' Bosley Crowther wrote in The Times. ''Nor is it another 'Casablanca.' But it will keep you warm for an hour.'' (Warner Archive)THE LAST OF THE UNJUST Too long and complicated to include in ''Shoah,'' Claude Lanzmann's 220-minute interview with Benjamin Murmelstein, the last Jewish elder of the ''model'' ghetto Theresienstadt, is a provocative and disturbing document, not least because Mr. Lanzmann is no match for his brilliant, morally ambiguous subject. The film is a ''portrait of an individual whose actions still defy comprehension, and the self-portrait of an artist consumed by the past,'' Mr. Scott wrote in The Times in February.

The rest of the movie, in which a monocle-wearing Gestapo mastermind (George Sanders), who also happens to be a big-game hunter, pursues Pidgeon back to London, is beautifully lit, expertly directed and considerably enlivened by the presence of Joan Bennett, obviously enjoying herself in the role of the teenage cockney quasi-prostitute who comes to Pidgeon's aid. Her martyrdom is a sacrifice, on the altar of freedom and to the requirements of the Production Code.  NEWLY RELEASED  BURNING BUSH Working for HBO Europe, the Polish director Agnieszka Holland made a hectic, bruising four-hour mini-series about the martyrdom of Jan Palach, a student who set himself aflame to protest the Soviet invasion and occupation of Czechoslovakia. ''The film does a remarkably persuasive job of capturing the nightmarish and sometimes grimly comical quality of life under totalitarianism,'' A. O. Scott wrote in The New York Times in June. (Kino Lorber)  FHRER CULT AND MEGALOMANIA A documentarian who has worked extensively with German archival footage, Michael Kloft has conducted a fascinating excavation of Nazi Nuremberg, the medieval city selected by Hitler to be a Third Reich shrine, the site of grandiose constructions and party rallies, most infamously memorialized in Leni Riefenstahl's ''Triumph of the Will.'' (First Run)  IDA Set in the early 1960s, Pawel Pawlikowski's adroit, subtle and sensitive account of a teenage novice who discovers that she was born a Jew, is like a Polish film from that period that could not have been made then. ''Mr. Pawlikowski has made one of the finest European films (and one of most insightful films about Europe, past and present) in recent memory,'' Mr. Scott wrote in The Times in May. (Music Box)  THE DESERT SONG Warner Bros.' 1943 Technicolor version of the Sigmund Romberg operetta, directed by the French-born filmmaker Robert Florey, was not only updated with an anti-Nazi premise but also, more surprisingly, has a marked anticolonial angle. ''This picture is not flattering to the prewar French military caste,'' Bosley Crowther wrote in The Times. ''Nor is it another 'Casablanca.' But it will keep you warm for an hour.'' (Warner Archive)  THE LAST OF THE UNJUST Too long and complicated to include in ''Shoah,'' Claude Lanzmann's 220-minute interview with Benjamin Murmelstein, the last Jewish elder of the ''model'' ghetto Theresienstadt, is a provocative and disturbing document, not least because Mr. Lanzmann is no match for his brilliant, morally ambiguous subject. The film is a ''portrait of an individual whose actions still defy comprehension, and the self-portrait of an artist consumed by the past,'' Mr. Scott wrote in The Times in February.

Each program devised by its artistic director, the soprano Jessica Gould, presents pre-Romantic music in the context of other art forms in unusual locations across Manhattan that are tailored to the evening's theme. For the first concert of the new season on Thursday, that theme was ''The Heirs of Tantalus,'' a survey of Baroque opera arias devoted to some of the more decadent characters from Greek myth and Roman history. The location, the Broad Street Ballroom, a block from the New York Stock Exchange, could not have been more apt.Tantalus, after all, was the son of Zeus, whose hubris was punished with an eternal state of unquenched desire, as he stood knee-deep in waters that receded whenever he bowed down to drink, with fruit hanging overhead that moved out of reach whenever he tried to grasp it. The building, at 41 Broad Street, adjacent to an Herms boutique, is now the exclusive Lman Manhattan Preparatory School, which charges upward of $35,000 a year for prekindergarten tuition: tantalizingly out of reach of most mortals. When it opened in 1929 as the headquarters of Lee, Higginson & Company, the fresco-covered hall with mosaic-encrusted marble columns and thick bronze doors served as the banking hall.If there was anything tantalizing about the evening, though, it was the musical program itself, which included some of the most ravishing arias by Monteverdi, Handel and Scarlatti: works that, in themselves, should have made for a satisfying musical experience. But while the instrumental ensemble, led by Jory Vinikour at the harpsichord and including fine musicians from the Sebastians, played with stylistic authority and rhythmic verve, the singing ranged from the indifferent to the painfully inadequate. The actors Florencia Lozano, Ethan Peck and Steven Rattazzi -- though evidently capable -- were left to swish their togas over the floor while reading from a script written by Erica Gould (Ms. Gould's sister) that was poised awkwardly between recitation and re-enactment.The countertenor Jos Lemos acquitted himself honorably in his arias, though his voice sounded diffuse, compared with the hearty vigor of the instrumentalists. In the lament ''Voi che udite,'' from Handel's ''Agrippina,'' the dark glow of his lower register blended beautifully with the sighing strings. But Ms. Gould -- who evidently won herself over at her own audition -- looked and sounded ill at ease. Though she is capable of producing a warm and appealing tone, her runs were sluggish, and she often sang off pitch. In ''Pensieri, voi mi tormentate,'' from ''Agrippina,'' with its gorgeous oboe solo (played with tender expression by Meg Owens), Ms. Gould's intonation was painfully out of sync with the instrument.From the harpsichord, Mr. Vinikour conducted Ms. Gould's arias with micromanaging desperation, cuing every vocal flourish with splayed hands and wiggling fingers. The audience, with no printed program order for guidance (an accidental oversight, apparently), was left in the dark, unsure when -- and whether -- to clap.Salon Sanctuary returns on Oct. 26 with Monica Huggett and New York Baroque Incorporated in ''The Virtuosi of Cthen,'' at the Abigail Adams Smith Auditorium, 417 East 61st Street, Manhattan; (646) 470-1837, salonsanctuaryconcerts.org.URL: http://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/23/arts/music/salon-sanctuary-opens-with-the-heirs-of-tantalus.htmlLOAD-DATE: September 23, 2013LANGUAGE: ENGLISHGRAPHIC: PHOTO: The Heirs of Tantalus: Ethan Peck performing in this production, a Salon Sanctuary survey of Baroque opera arias, at the Broad Street Ballroom in Lower Manhattan.

Rehnquist, ending months of increasingly frenzied speculation about his retirement plans, declared on Thursday night that he would continue to serve ''as long as my health permits.'' The chief justice's announcement, released without advance notice by his family, was completely unexpected and took the White House and Supreme Court officials by surprise. It first appeared on The Associated Press wire shortly before 9 p.m. The statement said: ''I want to put to rest the speculation and unfounded rumors of my imminent retirement. I am not about to announce my retirement. I will continue to perform my duties as chief justice as long as my health permits.''  The White House welcomed the announcement. ''The chief justice is doing an outstanding job, and we are pleased he will continue his great service to the nation,'' said Scott McClellan, the president's spokesman. The 80-year-old chief justice, who learned in October that he had thyroid cancer, had returned hours earlier to his home in suburban Arlington, Va., after spending two nights at the nearby Virginia Hospital Center, where he was treated for a fever.  Photographers were camped out in front of the house as they had been for weeks, recording his daily trip to and from his chambers at the court and awaiting word of a retirement that was expected in many quarters to be imminent. The prospect that the scene on his lawn, with its overtones of a ghoulish death watch, would continue all summer was evidently what drove the famously tight-lipped chief justice to issue his statement.  Last Friday morning, when a reporter shouted a question about retirement at him as he left for work, he replied: ''That's for me to know and you to find out.'' The rumors that flooded Washington throughout the remainder of the day became almost comical, as when the columnist Robert D. Novak declared on CNN that the chief justice's retirement would be announced at 4:50 that afternoon. The announcement Thursday night of Chief Justice Rehnquist's actual intentions freed the Bush administration to concentrate on finding a replacement for Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, who two weeks ago unexpectedly announced her intention to retire. Since then, many in official Washington and in the interest groups that are gearing up for a major confirmation battle had assumed that another shoe would soon drop in the form of a retirement announcement from the chief justice. Inside the court, on the other hand, the assumption had been growing, in the absence of any concrete information, that Chief Justice Rehnquist intended to remain on the job and that he had communicated this decision to Justice O'Connor before she made her retirement decision final. The chief justice's health has appeared relatively stable since he returned to the bench in March. The fever that sent him to the hospital in an ambulance on Tuesday night evidently did not represent a major setback.  Last fall, his cancer was treated with chemotherapy and radiation. It is not known whether he is currently under active treatment. He still has a tracheotomy, a hole in his throat that surgeons opened in October to help him breathe. Even for the Supreme Court, an institution in which secrecy is prized and information is tightly controlled, the events of the past two weeks have been startling. Justice O'Connor informed her colleagues of her decision barely an hour before the public announcement. Her children learned about it from television. On Thursday night, court officials learned of Chief Justice Rehnquist's statement only when reporters began calling to confirm the Associated Press bulletin. It quickly became obvious that the chief justice had taken matters into his own hands.URL: http://www.nytimes.comLOAD-DATE: July 15, 2005LANGUAGE: ENGLISHGRAPHIC: Photo: Chief Justice William H.

Before we could finish typing the words ''do they'' the search engine autofilled ''still make quaaludes.''Sadly, I've been advised that this is most likely an artificially inflated search result. But it occurred to me to see what else might be autofilled, as a sort of unscientific poll or cross-sectional sample of my fellow human beings' furtive curiosity and desires. I typed in ''Why am I'' and got: so tired/always cold/so ugly? ''Why does'': salt melt ice/my vagina itch/it snow? ''Where is'': my refund/Sochi/Chuck Norris? ''Why can't'': we be friends/I own a Canadian/I cry? I felt fondly toward all depraved humanity. According to the calendar, our long, dark winter is over. Yet those five months without light or exercise, hunching our shoulders in pain whenever we stepped outside, bingeing on Netflix, Jiffy Pop and booze, have left us all at the ends of our respective ropes. (Why does it snow?) Now, by the end of it, I find myself inappropriately cheered by glimpses of my fellow human beings' despair.E.g.: My friend Kevin urgently texted me from a stall of the men's room at work to inform me that someone in there was evidently in dire emotional/gastrointestinal distress -- I'm eliding a lot of detail here -- ending with the intelligence, stage-whispered in all capitals: ''... AND I THINK HE IS CRYING!'' It filled me with a soaring joy.This isn't schadenfreude; it's something more complicated for which, as far as I know, there isn't a German compound, but if there were it'd be something like mitleidfreude, compassion-joy -- compassion in the literal sense of ''suffering with.'' It is the happiness, or at least consolation, of knowing that Things Are Tough All Over, that everyone else is secretly as wretched as I am -- all of us weeping and pooping, Googling 'ludes.Not long ago I went to the East Village's Russian and Turkish Baths with my friend Jenny. People do not look their best coming out of the baths; they're pink and puffy, their hair damp, any makeup they were wearing when they went in boiled off. On her way out, Jenny looked at herself in the mirror in the women's changing room, made some token effort at fixing herself up, then sighed resignedly. The girl next to her -- who was younger, in her 20s -- reproached her in sororal solidarity: ''No, don't do that!'' she told her. ''We are all beautiful!'' At the very moment my friend was telling me this little story, out in the foyer, a woman in her 40s or 50s, passing by us, glanced at herself in the mirror and muttered to herself: ''Someone should just kill me.'' Jenny and I looked at each other, speechless with glee.Some people -- quite a lot of them, evidently -- are sustained by the ''Chicken Soup for the Soul'' book franchise. Yet I require something more pungent than schmaltz in my emotional diet. I never go to any movie I suspect might be about the Triumph of the Human Spirit, either. Maybe it's perverse of me, but I am comforted by the knowledge that we're all suffering a lot more than we let on.I'm not just ghoulishly thriving off others' pain; I'm happy to offer up my own if it's any use or consolation. A friend of mine lost her father a few weeks ago, and still lies awake at night sick with guilt, torturing herself by wondering what she should have done differently in his last hours. I ventured to confess to her, incommensurate to her own grief though it was, that I still wake up in the night panicking that I might've accidentally killed my cat with a flea fogger, even though the cat was 19 years old and obviously moribund. To my relief, this delighted her. She now uses ''flea fogger'' as mental shorthand to stop herself from second-guessing herself into insanity.A pastor I know, who gets a more privileged vista of human suffering than I do, told me she was sick of the phrase ''first-world problems'' -- not just because it delegitimizes the perfectly real problems of those of us lucky enough to have enough to eat and Internet access, but because it denies the same stupid trivial human worries to people who aren't. Are you not entitled to existential angst or tedium vitae if you live in Chad -- must you always nobly suffer traditional third-world problems like malaria and coups d'tat? If we're lucky, we graduate to increasingly complex and better problems, and once all our material needs are satisfied we get to confront the insoluble problem of being a person in the world.Even if we someday solve all our societal problems, people will still be unlucky in love, lonesome and bored, lie awake worrying about the future and regretting stupid things they did and wondering whether it's all even worth it. Utopia will have an unendurable amount of hassles to deal with, endless forms to fill out, apathetic bureaucrats, taxes, ads and bad weather. Time will still pass without mercy.A few days ago I got dumped. The problem with breakup talks is that only one of you has a script: The other one just sits there stupidly, mouth open, not understanding anything, saying things like, ''So, wait -- is this a breakup talk?'' As I write this, our brief fake-out spring has been temporarily revoked, and it's raw and wet and cold out again, the wind maliciously ripping umbrellas inside-out, mocking our pitiful, spindly defenses. I saw people literally screaming as the wind hit them in the streets, not in pain so much as in ''there is no God'' outrage and despair. I'm still trying to reconstruct that breakup conversation, trying to make sense of what was said and belatedly coming up with responses. It's one of those days where you have to force yourself through the motions, when the accumulated number of times you've had to make coffee and brush your teeth in your life seem too much to be borne, and doing the laundry like one of the labors of Hercules. Someone should just kill me. You sit on the edge of the bed for just one more minute, psyching yourself up to put on the other sock and commence yet another Tuesday. Why can't I cry? Where is my refund? Do they still make 'ludes?URL: http://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/27/opinion/sunday/the-feast-of-pain.htmlLOAD-DATE: April 27, 2014LANGUAGE: ENGLISHDOCUMENT-TYPE: Op-EdPUBLICATION-TYPE: NewspaperCopyright 2014 The New York Times Company41 of 50 DOCUMENTSThe New York Times Blogs(ArtsBeat)November 16, 2007 FridayBerlin in Lights: The Woman QuestionBYLINE: JAMES R. OESTREICHSECTION: ARTSLENGTH: 515 wordsHIGHLIGHT: Whenever the Vienna Philharmonic comes to Carnegie Hall, much is made of its glacial progress in hiring female players.

The Berlin orchestra hired its first woman, [&#8230;] Whenever the Vienna Philharmonic comes to Carnegie Hall, much is made of its glacial progress in hiring female players. The Berlin Philharmonic, which plays at Carnegie Hall tonight in the closing weekend of the Berlin in Lights festival, has also had to overcome a long history of exclusion. The Berlin orchestra hired its first woman, the violinist Madeleine Carruzzo, in 1982, though the achievement was quickly overshadowed by a noisy fracas between the players and Herbert von Karajan, then the orchestra's chief conductor, over the hiring of the clarinetist Sabine Meyer, who eventually bowed out of the running.The quarter-century mark seems as good a time as any to take stock. Of the 125 players on the Berlin Philharmonic's current roster, 17 are women, slightly less than 14 percent. (By comparison, at the Vienna Philharmonic, which hired its first woman in 1997, of the "approximately" 125 members in what is evidently a time of transition, 2, or less than 2 percent, are women.) For whatever reasons, 13 of the Berlin women are string players: 9 violinists, 3 violists and a cellist. There are also a flutist, a bassoonist, a horn player and a harpist.Stefan Stahnke, the press representative of the Berlin Philharmonic, said yesterday that the issue of female representation is not raised at all anymore in Berlin or on the orchestra's travels. (Then, perhaps to mollify present company, he allowed that "every once in a while" someone raises the question.)  The orchestra is taking no special measures to redress the balance, he said; it will be left to "a natural process of selection."Or rather - inevitably - a human process of selection, in this case all too human. The orchestra, Mr. Stahnke said, conducts its auditions on an open stage, without using screens to shield the identity (sex, race or whatever) of the candidate, contrary to common practice at least at American orchestras.Mr. Stahnke cited another contrast to most orchestras, in which members of the pertinent sections administer auditions. The Berlin Philharmonic invites all players to all auditions. Each member of the orchestra, including its principal conductor, Simon Rattle, casts one vote.However one chooses to characterize the pace of change and the balance of the sexes in relation to those of, say, the New York Philharmonic or the Vienna Philharmonic, things have indeed changed in Berlin, and the orchestra has evidently learned to adapt. Until recently, that is, when the female cellist, Solne  Kermarrec, entered the picture.Her presence has created an amusing poser for a group that calls itself the 12 Cellists of the Berlin Philharmonic when it performs as an independent unit, as it did on Monday at Zankel Hall. In German, a male cellist is a Cellist, several of them are Cellisten, and a dozen are 12 Cellisten; a female cellist is a Cellistin, and several are Cellistinnen. As the name of a group  (with all due respect to "100 Men and a Girl," the 1937 film featuring Leopold Stokowski), 11 Cellisten und eine Cellistin loses a certain catchiness, to say nothing of egalitarianism.LOAD-DATE: April 29, 2016LANGUAGE: ENGLISHDOCUMENT-TYPE: NewsPUBLICATION-TYPE: Web BlogCopyright 2007 The News York Times CompanyAll Rights Reserved42 of 50 DOCUMENTS The New York TimesOctober 6, 2002 Sunday   Late Edition - Final MUSIC; Of Ravel's Many 'Students,' the Real OneBYLINE:  By BERNARD HOLLANDSECTION: Section 2; Column 1; Arts and Leisure Desk; Pg. 32LENGTH: 931 wordsVLADO PERLEMUTER, the fastidious French pianist, died last month at 98. He wore the title Student of Ravel. More precisely, he was the one true student of Ravel.     There were plenty of the other kind. My teacher at the Paris Conservatory, possessed of extraordinary technical ability and garish Romantic taste, was one of them. She was the youngest (and remained so until recently, I understand) to have won the school's first prize for piano playing, having done so at 11. So off she went to the master, knowing the notes of "Gaspard de la Nuit," "Alborada del Gracioso" and other such ticklish virtuoso pieces. Ravel, she says, heard her out courteously, made suggestions in his own hand on the margins of her scores and corrected misprints. Durand, the Paris publisher, still held the copyrights to Debussy and Ravel and allowed a number of serious mistakes to stand for years.   Ravel's thoughts, so briefly noted, evidently had little effect on my teacher. She played well into old age, using near-grotesque ritardandos accompanied by a note-perfection that was remarkable, given that she never practiced. But in that brief meeting, a mutually profitable transaction took place. My teacher could ever after say that she had studied with Ravel (catnip to any prospective private pupil). Ravel had collected his very high fee and, with elegant politeness, shown her the door.Many a dollar, franc, mark and euro has been made from the "student of" strategy. Pedagogical genealogy gives off a captivating historical shine. How imposing to be a student of Hofmann, a student of a student of Leschitizky, a pupil three generations removed of Liszt. Sometimes even Czerny and Beethoven appear murkily at the end of some lineages.Czerny, who studied Beethoven with Beethoven, later produced editions of the piano sonatas. They remain necessary study for serious thinkers, and yet their staggering corruptness has led generations of piano students down a number of blind alleys. Could you believe, having listened successively to the "Lyric Pieces" and then the "March of Alexander," that the author of the first (Grieg) had been a student of the second (Ignaz Moscheles)? Grieg was trained in piano virtuosity, but he looked within himself and rejected flash and, eventually, German formalism (although it haunted him). The utter simplicity of his best music had no teacher. The teacher-to-pupil transfer can be much, very little or often nothing.An old saw says that there are no great teachers, only great students. It can be put another way. Successful teachers know how to attract talent. Often they have little to teach; the extraordinary students come to the lessons and learn by themselves. When such people emerge into major careers, know that the grand master will be there to take a lot of the credit.Sometimes the contact can be profound. I remember Messiaen's students following the great man from the classroom onto the street and into the subway. (The teacher did once remark that he had learned more from Pierre Boulez, his student, than the other way around.) Daniel Barenboim as a boy was evidently deeply affected by his studies with Wilhelm Furtwangler.Piano pedagogy in postwar Vienna was split sharply between the Bruno Seidlhofer and Richard Hauser camps. Seidlhofer was a philosopher of style and the precise interpretation of scores, willing to spend an hour of lesson time agonizing over whether a Mozart ornamental turn should begin on the upper appoggiatura (and thus consist of four notes) or on the principal tone (five notes). Hauser was the famous Mr. Fix-It. Can't play that passage? Use this finger, not the other one; raise your elbow a little. The conflict between spirit and body waxed hot and heavy in inexpensive cafes near the conservatory.Most serious piano students enjoy (suffer?) three or four teachers over the length of their education. Generally, one gets a little information from each. Progress is often marked by small physical flashes of inspiration. What was previously troublesome reveals its secrets. Sometimes the flashes come from an odd word or a simple observation. Natural virtuosos can be the worst teachers, because they cannot explain how they do what they do.My Paris teacher was like this, but one still learned, simply from watching her at the keyboard: I am so tense, and she is the picture of relaxation. What costs me such physical effort she accomplishes with a minimum of gesture.THERE are limits to the monkey-see, monkey-do approach, and they can be noted in the work of teachers private and institutional. The approach is this: Teach students to play a piece, then have them practice it for months and play it in a class recital. Class recitals, well executed, validate the teacher's work. The student's sense of accomplishment is all to the good, as is the growth of physical coordination. But really only the student's fingers have learned. Ask him or her the piece's layout, what key it is in, and receive blank stares. Ask the student to play the memorized piece at half speed, and witness collapse. It is a bit like reciting Shakespeare without knowing the alphabet.The truly talented survive bad teaching. In fact it is almost a prerequisite for success.Ravel-Perlemuter was the real goods. Teacher took student through the music meticulously and at length. This is why Perlemuter's detailed little book written with Helene Jourdan-Morhange, "Ravel d'Apres Ravel," leaves us so much to learn. I doubt that my Paris teacher even opened it or knew that it existed. Still, there she was: Student of Ravel. Be wary.URL: http://www.nytimes.com LOAD-DATE: October 6, 2002  LANGUAGE: ENGLISH GRAPHIC: Photo: Vlado Perlemuter passed on his teacher's ideas in a little book.

THATCHER SEE CLOSE TIES TO REAGANBYLINE: Special to the New York TimesSECTION: Section A; Page 1, Column 2; Foreign DeskLENGTH: 630 wordsDATELINE: BONN, Nov. 17On the eve of Chancellor Helmut Schmidt's departure for the United States, both he and Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher of Britain stressed their confidence today that close cooperation between Europe and America would be renewed under the Republican administration of President-elect Ronald Reagan.The two European leaders, ending two days of consultations here, said at a joint news conference that they had discussed the demands of the United States that its NATO allies meet pledges of a 3 percent increase in military spending, evidently with a view to easing the friction with Washington over the fact that both countries had indicated they might not be able to meet the target in 1981.While both leaders seemed reluctant to commit themselves in public to a 3 percent increase, a spokesman for the Chancellor pledged that ''Bonn will fulfill its commitments to the North Atlantic alliance.'' The spokesman, Klaus Bolling, said Mr. Schmidt would make it clear at a meeting with President Carter on Thursday that West Germany was prepared to expand military expenditures for next year ''to avoid a conflict with Washington.''Because the West German economy is expected to be virtually stagnant in 1981, the Bonn Government had projected a growth of only 1.8 percent in military spending next year, in line with cuts in other fields. This year the growth was 2.8 percent, just below the target.At the news conference, Mrs. Thatcher said she could not make any predictions about British military spending in 1981 ''except to say that it will be greater than this year.'' Britain met the 3 percent target in 1979 and is expected to do so this year, she said. Mr.  Schmidt merely pointed out that the increases were pledged to be in real terms, that is, they were to take account of inflation.Mr. Schmidt is scheduled to confer with some of Mr. Reagan's advisers in Washington, but officials said there seemed little chance of his meeting with Mr. Reagan himself.Evidently in preparation for the trip, Finance Minister Hans Matthofer said there were plans for the 1981 West German budget to grow beyond earlier projections.Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher, in a separate statement, declared that West Germany would fulfill its long-term military commitments. ''No one will have reason to doubt our word,'' he said, adding that ''any attempt to losen our ties to the United States will not find a majority in this country.'' A Warning to LeftistsMr. Genscher, who is the head of the Free Demo crats, the Chancellor's small coalition partners, evidently meant his words as awarning to le ft-wing elements in Mr. Schmidt's Social Democratic Party who are opposed to increased military spending.At the news conference, the Chancellor recalled pledges by Mr.  Reagan of increased consultations with the European allies and said that was one of the reasons ''why we look ahead with expectations and confidence to a renewal of European-American cooperation under a new administration.''His remark was seen to imply criticism of the Carter Administration over what the West Germans and other Europeans have called an inadequate consultation process and lack of leadership from Washington.Mrs. Thatcher said that in view of the uncertainties in Afghanistan, Eastern Europe and elsewhere it was essential to enlarge areas of stability in the world.

Initial reports had prompted speculation that the attackers might be Israeli settlers.The army did not say what the squad was doing in Hizmeh. Israeli television said the soldiers were in the process of arresting a Palestinian when villagers began pelting them with stones. Witnesses in Hizmeh, however, said the plainclothesmen did not try to arrest anyone and were never stoned. They said the man who died, a 60-year-old villager, was first shot in the legs and then apparently beaten to death.According to numerous accounts by residents of the village, which is nestled in rocky hills between Jerusalem and Ramallah, the incident began at about 5:20 P.M. when Palestinians sitting in their house noticed three unfamiliar men sitting on some nearby rocks. Hamza Salahaddin, 20, went out to see who they were.Mr. Salahaddin's brother, Mahmoud, said he looked out the window and saw the men knock Mr. Salahaddin to the ground and bash him on the head, sending blood streaming down his face. His shouts brought people pouring out of nearby houses, and the three Israelis, evidently feeling threatened, pulled out pistols and put one to Mr. Salahaddin's head, dragging him back into a rocky field.Four Palestinians, including three of Mr. Salahaddin's relatives, approached the men, demanding that they release him. Instead, the Israelis fired into the air and then at the approaching men, hitting Mr. Salahaddin's uncle in the leg, and his father-in-law in both legs. According to several accounts, they grabbed the father-in-law, Muhammad al-Hillo, 60, and beat him on the head with what witnesses thought was a walkie-talkie until he fell senseless.Mr. Salahaddin managed to get away, while some villagers ran to a nearby roadblock to summon Israeli soldiers. When the soldiers arrived, the three undercover men pulled out army caps, evidently to identify themselves, and the Israelis drove Mr. Hillo to a hospital, where he was pronounced dead. Villagers insisted that no stones were thrown at the undercover men, since they were holding Mr. Salahaddin. Later, when it was announced over the radio that Mr. Hillo had died, village youths pelted army vehicles with stones.      LOAD-DATE: February 26, 1997LANGUAGE: ENGLISHCopyright 1997 The New York Times Company45 of 50 DOCUMENTSThe New York TimesOctober 23, 2007 Tuesday  Late Edition - FinalBad Enough Being Shoeless But Just Look at This DecorBYLINE: By JOE SHARKEY. On the Road appears each Tuesday. E-mail: jsharkey@nytimes.comSECTION: Section C; Column 0; Business/Financial Desk; ON THE ROAD; Pg. 6LENGTH: 674 wordsAT the airport security checkpoints, I always look at the hodgepodge of folding tables and figure that somewhere,  a church basement  is missing its furniture.  That was going through my mind the other day while leaving the Tucson airport. I'd been away from home for more than  a week working, so my carry-on and laptop were stuffed with files.  Passengers and screeners alike all looked as if  they were silently humming ''Sixteen Tons.'' Hoist those bags! Keep those bins moving!    In front of me was a uniformed pilot guiding himself and two small girls, both with their pink rollaboards, through the checkpoint. I'm always amazed at how parents can maneuver bag-laden children  in those circumstances without losing at least a backpack, let alone a child.  One screener was evidently  in charge of ensuring that passengers knew they had to remove those  portable CPAP devices (for continuous positive airway pressure) that have become popular travel accessories  for the growing number of  people  diagnosed with  sleep apnea, a common ailment in which airways tighten, interrupting sleep.     ''Take all CPAPs out of your carry-on bags,'' the screener kept saying.  Behind me a woman put her backpack on the roller belt. Wearing latex gloves, the screener pressed on a small bulge in the backpack.  ''Is that a CPAP, ma'am? It looks like a CPAP,'' the screener said.  ''It also looks like a chicken sandwich, which is what it is,'' the woman replied wearily.  In front of me, the pilot's children were now safely on the other side of the magnetometer. He heaved his own stuff onto the belt and removed his shoes.  ''I thought you guys didn't have to take your shoes off if you were in uniform,'' I said.   He gave me a look and said, ''Do not get me started.''  On the other side of the magnetometer, there was the usual pile-up that always reminds me of that classic ''I Love Lucy''  episode where the assembly line at the candy  factory  flips into warp speed. Bags, bins and laptops piled up while kids and adults hopped on one foot to put on their shoes as screeners scrambled to haul empty bins away.  We spend about  $5 billion a year in federal money on airport security. Yes, screeners do good work under tough conditions, and, yes, the Transportation Security Administration is working on better technology for better security.   But why do the checkpoints still look like garage sales?  ''Don't get me started,'' said Ira Weinstein, the president of AIR Inc., a market research and consulting company that works with airports. Evidently it's the new catch phrase.  ''There are no standards of furniture or fixtures from airport to airport. It seems to all be under the auspices of the T.S.A. and/or the airport and/or nobody knows,'' Mr. Weinstein said, adding: ''The furniture is usually folding bridge chairs  --  $59 to $69 a table at Kmart. At some airports, they bought stainless-steel autopsy tables, but they don't match up either, and you still have people getting fingers bruised or cut as bags pile up or fall off.''   There have been scattered improvements, he said. The Atlanta airport bought tables actually designed to match the X-ray machines. A few airports have sold advertising space on newly designed bins, and some have bought systems to move bins back to the front of the queue so that ''screeners who ought to be doing security aren't working as bin collectors,'' he said.  Given bare or stockinged feet, the lack of floor mats is also a chronic problem,  Mr. Weinstein said. Matt Blaze, an associate professor of computer science  at the University of Pennsylvania and an expert in security cryptology, agreed.  ''Somehow we ended up with this cobbled-together mess,'' he said. ''At the very point in the process at which you have to take your shoes off, that's where the carpeting ends.''  From a customer service standpoint, it's ''infuriating,'' he said. But  disorder  also  raises genuine security concerns.   ''There's no better place to get away with something than a chaotic environment,'' he said.URL: http://www.nytimes.comLOAD-DATE: October 23, 2007LANGUAGE: ENGLISHGRAPHIC: DRAWING (DRAWING BY CHRIS GASH)                                                                    PUBLICATION-TYPE: NewspaperCopyright 2007 The New York Times Company46 of 50 DOCUMENTSThe New York TimesMay 30, 1997, Friday, Late Edition - FinalSomain Journal;2 'Perfect Little Girls' Stun France in SuicideBYLINE: By ROGER COHEN SECTION: Section A; Page 4; Column 3; Foreign Desk LENGTH: 961 wordsDATELINE: SOMAIN, France, May 23The girls had been talking about it to their friends for a while. How, like Kurt Cobain of Nirvana, they would kill themselves. They wore his T-shirts; they worshiped his grunge rock sound. But they were model pupils from model families, and sleepy Somain is a long way from Seattle.So everyone thought that the girls -- Valentine Defontaine, 12, and her friend Aurelie Leleu, 13 -- were joking. First in class, they were popular and unproblematic. When, on the morning of May 14, Aurelie gave her friend Lydie Brassens a Nirvana tape and said she would not see her again because she planned to put a bullet through her head, Lydie told her "to quit being stupid."  After school, Valentine went to Aurelie's house. Their friend Clement Gressier, 11, found them there, listening to Nirvana and watching a Cobain video and playing around with a Beretta pistol. He asked to examine the gun. It was loaded. When he tried to leave with it, Aurelie blocked his way. So, he said, he tried to make light of things: "If you want to commit suicide," he told them, "commit suicide. See if I care."But Clement cared, and 20 minutes later he went back with two friends. What he found still makes his lips tremble. Valentine was "kind of half on the bed and half on the wall with all this blood coming out her mouth," he said, and Aurelie was on the floor with the side of her head blown off.Somain, a former mining town of 12,000 people 110 miles north of Paris, is under a double shadow: the old one formed by an economic slump that has left close to 30 percent of people in the area unemployed, and the new one left by the suicides. A sense of incomprehension that amounts to an acute expression of the national mood pervades the town, where the closed mines, the closed steel mills, the downsized glass factory and the relentless buffeting of American popular culture have combined to produce the sort of social and psychological disarray that makes France's political direction so volatile.At the record store, Eliane Wysocki still sells Cobain T-shirts and the icon-smashing 1991 album "Nevermind" that propelled the Seattle band to fame. But her world has been unmoored to the point where the other day she asked her healthy and happy 12-year-old daughter if she had contemplated suicide."You feel you don't understand anything anymore," she said. "You are afraid to leave kids alone. These girls were bright and from good families. But there is this ennui here and this emptiness with the industry gone and the place becoming a dormitory town. I have the feeling that life is escaping me as if it were a machine moving too fast."Outside the Victor Hugo school, which the girls attended, teen-agers hang around talking. They wear reversed baseball caps and Nike sneakers and jeans and they talk about how Somain is a prison and the lack of jobs and how they will get out one day. They explain how Valentine and Aurelie were part of a group of about 20 devoted to Nirvana and how, since the suicides, their parents have made them remove all Cobain posters from their rooms.It is clear that, through an unlikely and perhaps dimly understood identification, these French children have come to perceive Cobain's suicide at the age of 27 on April 8, 1994, and the howling defiance of his lyrics -- "I'd rather be dead than cool," he sang in "Stay Away" on the "Nevermind" album -- as the image of their alienation.There have been isolated instances of Cobain-inspired suicides -- at least two in America and one in Italy.  But never, it seems, has there been a case involving children so young.Valentine's parents both teach at the Victor Hugo school. Aurelie's parents are managers at a Renault plant. Neither of the girls had ever expressed despair to their parents, who declined to discuss the suicides. Neither of the girls had ever been treated for psychological problems."They were model girls and model students, the best we have," said Eric Specq, the headmaster of the school."Evidently Cobain was their secret garden. They wanted to break with the image of perfect little girls, and in grunge they found the expression of this defiance. Perhaps it was because they had never disappointed that they did not want to disappoint the friends to whom they had vowed they would commit suicide."The girls' suicides were evidently deeply personal; perhaps they neither prove nor illustrate anything; yet they came in a context that troubles Mr. Specq. He talks about the "Gallic-American culture" that now dominates in the school and throughout Somain. The American look; the children with names like Steve and Kevin; the movies and the music and the increasing use in speech of Americanisms."A cultural clash is healthy," Mr. Specq said. "It involves give and take. But here we are losing our culture entirely, and I believe this is tragic and dangerous."Two books of condolences for the girls have been compiled at the school. Above all they express incomprehension. But in their occasional use of English, they also reflect Mr. Specq's preoccupations. One student has ended his note by writing, "Forever, Jerome Copin."At the cemetery near the school, Aurelie's grave is piled with fresh flowers. Her parents were there, watering the flowers, and her little sister, scampering noisily over the grave. The little girl, like all of Somain, was evidently unable to grasp what had happened.Valentine, the police said, shot herself first; Aurelie evidently watched and then had the sang-froid to follow suit. Beside the girls there were several Cobain lyrics -- the police will not say which ones -- and this message from Aurelie: "My life is my death. My death is my life. I hope my life will be short and my death eternal."LOAD-DATE: May 30, 1997LANGUAGE: ENGLISHGRAPHIC: Photo: Students at Victor Hugo high school in Somain, France, at the funeral of two of their friends, Aurelie Leleu, 13, and Valentine Defontaine, 12, who, emulating the Nirvana singer Kurt Cobain, committed suicide.

The two-day decline shaved 8.6 percent off the share price. In an S.E.C. filing, the company said the commission's staff "has requested that the company voluntarily provide certain documents and information as part of an informal, nonpublic inquiry."The company said "the staff has not indicated the subject of the inquiry" and did not discuss in the filing what it might be about.American Capital executives did not return telephone calls from a reporter on Thursday or Friday regarding the filing, but they evidently provided additional information to analysts. In a report to clients on Thursday, Robert Napoli of U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray said the company's management had called him shortly after filing the S.E.C. report."While not specifically offering the reasons behind the inquiry, management did state that the issues would likely be consistent with the 'short' arguments, likely dealing with the valuation techniques of portfolio investments," he wrote. "The company stated that their auditor, Ernst & Young, has reviewed these issues and remains comfortable with the positions."Mr. Napoli reaffirmed his outperform rating on the shares.American Capital has been in the sights of short sellers, who bet that stocks will fall, and in mid-July the short position was almost 10 million shares. That was down from 12 million a month earlier, but was still substantial, amounting to 18 percent of the outstanding shares.American Capital has attracted investors by paying high dividends, which are fully taxable to investors because the company is able to avoid paying corporate taxes because it distributes its income to its investors.That is normal for investment companies, but American Capital is unusual because so much of its investment is concentrated in companies it controls. As of June 30, 51 percent of its investments were in companies in which it had a controlling equity stake.In some cases, it owns the entire company. For example, it has invested $39.3 million in American Decorative Surfaces International. The investment has not done very well, by American Capital's reckoning, and is now worth $28 million.But that performance has not kept American Capital from reporting income from the investment in American Decorative, a company formed last year to buy out the assets of a bankrupt company in which American Capital had invested.This year, American Capital has written down the value of its stake in American Decorative and has lent more money to it. But American Decorative has evidently been able to pay its interest to American Capital on the $25.7 million subordinated debt, and has thus provided revenue to its parent. The write-down has not affected the value of the debt, only of American Capital's 100 percent equity stake.That is in compliance with the accounting rules for investment companies. But it is not the way ordinary companies account for the performance of a wholly owned subsidiary. They would not consider the interest paid, but would instead reflect the profits, or loss, of the subsidiary. American Capital does not report that figure, although the fact that it wrote down the value of the equity probably does not indicate that the subsidiary is profitable.American Capital has paid high dividends for years, with the dividends based on the reported operating earnings. But it has also repeatedly sold more shares to raise capital, making eight separate offerings in the last three years. Richard B. Shane Jr., an analyst with Jefferies & Company, lowered his rating on the stock to hold yesterday, citing the S.E.C. questions."Access to capital is critical," Mr. Shane wrote, adding that the company could face difficulty in raising money if the S.E.C. concluded that the company had "inappropriately valued even a single investment."Insiders are apparently not worried. Malon Wilkus, the chairman and chief executive, did not return a phone call, but he did report to the S.E.C. that he had bought 2,000 shares yesterday, at $22.18. Philip R. Harper, a director, reported that he and his wife bought 51,852 shares at prices ranging from $22.25 to $22.88. URL: http://www.nytimes.com LOAD-DATE: August 16, 2003  LANGUAGE: ENGLISH PUBLICATION-TYPE: NewspaperCopyright 2003 The New York Times Company48 of 50 DOCUMENTSThe New York TimesSeptember 30, 2005 Friday  Late Edition - FinalGhosts in the Lens, Tricks in the DarkroomBYLINE: By MICHAEL KIMMELMANSECTION: Section E; PT2; Column 1; Leisure/Weekend Desk; PHOTOGRAPHY REVIEW; Pg. 33LENGTH: 1420 wordsWHO knows what suddenly possessed the Vicomte de Renneville in 1859, when he and a friend visited the Paris studio of the society photographer Andre-Adolphe-Eugene Disderi, but, bless his heart, we can be grateful that the spirit moved him as it did.  Posing for a carte de visite, the vicomte, after Disderi had snapped several dour shots of him in the de rigueur black frock coat and top hat, decided he would remove his clothes, all except socks and shoes, don what looks very much like a hot water bottle on his head but was in fact some sort of helmet, hold a shield and pretend to be a ghost. His friend (raised eyebrows, forefinger scratching forehead) acts as if the apparition startles him. (He doesn't look half startled enough.) Disderi also sloshed around some chemical on the exposed negative of the naked vicomte to make the image look less corporeal.What results, while slightly obscuring the body (about which the vicomte was either peculiarly proud or, like a good comic, heroically shameless in the service of a joke), is, alas, still not quite suited for a morning newspaper.   Fortunately, you may find the picture at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, hereafter known as the Swingin' Metropolitan Museum of Art, in a show titled ''The Perfect Medium: Photography and the Occult.'' Hands down, it's the most hilarious, not to mention the most charming, exhibition the museum has done in years. Like all examples of great humor, it is, at heart, also a sneakily serious affair. Its subjects include the depths of human gullibility and the conjuring power of photography, whose technology, we may forget in the cynical day of digital manipulation and Photoshop, seemed unfathomable to so many people a century and more ago.   The exhibition's deeper subject is the dreamer in all of us. The art in these ham-fisted photographs of transparent tomfoolery, such as it is, is generally not formal but mystical. I don't mean that the images of spirits and ectoplasms and mediums lofting card tables into the air are believable (although they are, I suppose, if you wish them to be). I mean that they inevitably sail past their intended goal, which is to document the unbelievable, and end up in a realm of higher truth. They remind us that art is a wonderment defying logic.   How else to describe, except in terms of wonderment, the deliciousness of the implausible image of the French medium Marguerite Beuttinger accompanied by her twin spirit, a trick of double exposure that evidently fooled somebody at one point. A blurry Marguerite is standing beside a seated Marguerite whose body is so slight that it makes her look like her own dwarf twin. The effect is marvelous, as is the multiple exposure of the ghost of Bernadette Soubirous, in white robes, gliding under a trellis, gradually evaporating into a brick wall.  And then there are the photographs of Eugenie Picquart, a medium who during seances was said to fall into a trance and incarnate the voice and physical appearance of Sarah Bernhardt and Mephistopheles. In one picture she is doing what looks like the Frug; in another, she sucks in her cheeks, sticks out her chest and rolls her eyes into her head like a toddler throwing a tantrum. She is rivaled in theatricality and sheer chutzpah by a certain Mrs. Wood, another medium; she snapped pictures of herself when she underwent her own transformation (evidently the one did not prevent the other), her Three Stooges-like expressions being, if not otherworldly, then certainly divine.  All humor depends on timing, and this show's is supernatural amid a spate of loopy prime-time television programs (''Medium,'' ''Supernatural'' and ''Ghost Whisperer'') and Hollywood films (''Just Like Heaven'') about spirits. More highbrow contemporary artists, with an eye on the history of spirit photography, have also delved into the topic lately (Tony Oursler, Laura Larson and others).   But spiritualism, if suddenly voguish, belongs to a longstanding strain of American freethinking. It caught on during the second half of the 19th century when grieving survivors of the Civil War longed to reunite with their dead relatives. Electricity, the X-ray, expansions on Mesmer's experiments with magnetism, and the telegraph, with its rat-tat-tat, in syncopation with the spiritualists' ghost rappings, reinforced the notion that there were all sorts of invisible forces at play in the world.   This was also the era of Barnum. The first spirit photographer, William H. Mumler, produced for Mary Todd Lincoln a picture showing her with the ghostly image of her dead husband. The picture was widely circulated. Even the fact that Mumler was prosecuted for fraud did not dissuade the faithful from believing what they saw.   Mumler's French equivalent, Edouard Isidore Buguet, plied his trade in Paris after the War of 1870. Put on trial and facing prison, Buguet freely admitted his pictures were fakes and offered up the equipment he had used to concoct them, but this only caused the spiritualists to assert he was a martyr to their cause and a medium despite himself. Buguet, like all good snake oil salesmen, capitalized on the notoriety and turned to producing spiritualist spoofs, spawning a fresh industry for ghost-filled recreational photographs. Eugene Thiebault contrived a particularly fine example of the genre, a publicity shot of Henri Robin, an illusionist, in the embrace of a cloaked and spectral skeleton.   Organized by Pierre Apraxine, the former curator of the Met's recently acquired Gilman Collection, whence many of these pictures come, the exhibition rather unusually declines to identify its subjects as hoaxes or to dwell on how they were fabricated. This makes for a curious catalog, scholastically speaking. The show itself, split into three not-too-big parts, also with minimal critical commentary, highlights pictures that manifest spirits, like Mumler's; pictures of mediums plying their trade, like Mrs. Wood; and pictures of ''vital fluids.''   The last, inspired by Mesmer's idea of ''animal magnetism'' and other harebrained theories of the time, exploited the premise that invisible powers flowed through the body. Laying hands on sensitized photographic plates, fluid photographers produced mysterious-looking images of fuzzy fingerprints that supposedly revealed these forces in action. That the images were in fact just the mundane consequence of sweat and body heat ought not to blind us now to the accidental eloquence of some of these semiabstract gems.  As formal photographs, seen across nearly a century of surrealism, they succeed where, say, the fairy pictures that Arthur Conan Doyle famously endorsed don't, the fakery of the fairies being merely banal. By contrast, there is the fakery of a medium called Margery (nee Mina Stinson), who dangled what looks like a bunch of soiled cheesecloth from her right nostril and declared it an ectoplasm. Or there is the medium Eva C., who, outdoing our exhibitionistic vicomte, posed totally naked (ostensibly to prove she had nothing up her sleeve) beside a ''spirit'' who resembles one of those cardboard cutouts of a mustachioed chef outside a French restaurant holding a fixed price menu. Fakery on such a level becomes sublime camp.  It illustrates the crucial gap between technology and art, another subtext of this show, whereby a photograph that may have looked amazing at one time looks ludicrous eventually. Artists today like Andreas Gursky, the magnificence of whose digitally manipulated landscapes and cityscapes depend on keeping ahead of the technological curve, flirt with this problem of obsolescence. You might say it's endemic to the medium.  Which leaves the odd case like Ted Serios. An elevator operator in Chicago who found that under hypnosis and with a few drinks under his belt, he could project images from his mind straight onto Polaroid film, in the 1960's, in cahoots with a Denver psychiatrist and psychic researcher, Jule Eisenbud, he produced thousands of ''thought photographs.'' These are creepy, blurry, off-kilter Blair Witch-like pictures of automobiles and hotels and shadowy men in uniform, which have yet to be fully explained away.  In hindsight they may come to look like Margery's ectoplasms, quaint relics of our own undying enchantment with the unseeable. Then again, who knows? Life, like art, can defy logic, too.''The Perfect Medium: Photography and the Occult'' is at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue at 82nd Street, (212)535-7710, through Dec. 31.URL: http://www.nytimes.comLOAD-DATE: September 30, 2005LANGUAGE: ENGLISHGRAPHIC: Photos: ''The Ghost of Bernadette Soubirous,'' taken by an unknown artist in France around 1890.

If So, His Voice Didn't Let OnBYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALDSECTION: Section A; Column 0; Metropolitan Desk; Pg. 23LENGTH: 824 wordsDATELINE: WASHINGTON The voices are breathtakingly calm, given the circumstances, as the pilot and controllers confront a terrifying series of events: bird strikes, a loss of thrust in both engines and the impossibility of staying aloft long enough to reach any runway.  The only sign of stress as the plane descends over the Hudson River is when controllers and even the pilot, Capt. Chesley B. Sullenberger III, flub the plane's call sign. But there is also a moment of disbelief. When the captain issues his final communication, ''We're gonna be in the Hudson,'' the controller replies, ''I'm sorry, say again, Cactus.''   Those are among the most dramatic moments in audio recordings of communications between US Airways Flight 1549 and controllers that were released on Thursday by the Federal Aviation Administration. All 155 aboard survived the plane's ditching in the Hudson on Jan. 15.  The recordings underscore how Captain Sullenberger, a former Air Force fighter pilot, evidently stuck to the pilots' motto of ''aviate, navigate, communicate'' and did not bother to answer the controller's question about ditching in the Hudson.   At that moment, his first officer was struggling vainly to restart the engines while Captain Sullenberger was trying to set the jet down smoothly near boats.  The non-routine part of the air-ground exchanges takes less than two minutes. At 3:27:32 p.m., 2 minutes and 32 seconds after Flight 1549 was cleared for takeoff, the radar controller working the La Guardia departures told Captain Sullenberger to turn left, over the Bronx.   Captain Sullenberger replied, ''Ah, this is, uh, Cactus 1539, hit birds, we lost thrust in both engines; we're turning back towards La Guardia.'' The tone is not far from normal in the chatter between pilots and controllers, a conversation that has its own etiquette and grammar, in which every exchange begins with the crew identifying the airplane, and every altitude, heading and other clearance is supposed to be read back for confirmation.  In the recording, Captain Sullenberger's voice is deep and a bit gravelly, with a brisk cadence and clipped syntax that is normal for communications between cockpits and controllers. If there was a sign of stress, it was that the captain fumbled his call sign; ''Cactus'' is the correct sign for US Airways, but he was Flight 1549, not 1539.   The controller replied instantly, ''O.K., yeah, you need to return to La Guardia; turn left heading of, uh, 220,'' that is, to the left. Captain Sullenberger acknowledged, and instantly the controller, in a windowless radar room at the New York Terminal Radar Approach Control on Long Island, used a land line to reach the control tower. ''Tower, stop your departures. We got an emergency returning,'' he said.   The controller's voice was urgent but not evidently stressed, until he, too, bungled the call sign, calling it ''1529.''   The controller turned his attention back to the plane. ''Cactus 1529, if we can get it to you, do you want to try to land Runway 1-3?''  Captain Sullenberger was in the unusual position of both flying an airliner and working the radio; talking on the radio is normally  the job of the other pilot, but in this case the first officer, Jeffrey B. Skiles, was running through an ''engine restart checklist.''   ''We're unable. We may end up in the Hudson,'' Captain Sullenberger replied, at 3:28:11, less than a minute after his first communication about the unfolding emergency.   The controller offered him directions to the runway.   ''Unable,'' Captain Sullenberger responded, in standard pilot phraseology.   The other La Guardia runway was also available, the controller said, and Captain Sullenberger replied, ''I am not sure if we can make any runway,'' and asked about ''anything in New Jersey, maybe Teterboro.'' Given a routing there, he replied, ''We can't do it.''  ''O.K.,'' said the controller. ''Which runway would you like at Teterboro?''  ''We're gonna be in the Hudson,'' the captain replied. He never used the word ''emergency,'' although the controllers in the radar room on Long Island and the towers at La Guardia and Teterboro reacted instantly as they were drawn into the problem.  His last communication was at 3:29:28, a few hundred feet over the Hudson.  Captain Sullenberger, the co-pilot and three flight attendants will describe their experiences in an interview with Katie Couric on ''60 Minutes,'' scheduled to be broadcast on Sunday on CBS, which released excerpts from the interview transcript on Thursday.  Captain Sullenberger described the moment he realized that the plane had lost power. ''It was the worst sickening, pit-of-your-stomach, falling-through-the-floor feeling I've ever felt in my life,'' he said. ''I knew immediately it was very bad.''   When Ms. Couric asked if his thought then was how they were going to get out of the situation, Captain Sullenberger replied: ''No. My initial reaction was one of disbelief.'' URL: http://www.nytimes.comLOAD-DATE: February 6, 2009LANGUAGE: ENGLISHPUBLICATION-TYPE: NewspaperCopyright 2009 The New York Times Company50 of 50 DOCUMENTS The New York TimesAugust 20, 2002 Tuesday   Late Edition - Final BUSINESS TRAVEL; MEMO PADBYLINE:  By JOE SHARKEY SECTION: Section C; Column 1; Business/Financial Desk; Pg. 9LENGTH: 524 wordsMore Companies Use Online BookingThe use of in-house company Web sites to book business travel is growing rapidly, according to a survey to be released this week.      Online booking was in use during the second quarter of 2002 by about 42 percent of companies surveyed, up from about 24 percent in the period last year, according to GetThere, the Sabre subsidiary that is a leading supplier of customized corporate booking technology.  Companies in the survey spent from $10 million to $300 million on business travel last year, with an average of $55 million, GetThere said. They reported an average saving on air fares of about 15 percent through employee online booking, rather than use of a company or a third-party travel agent. Larger companies tend to save most because "they have more leverage with airlines" in negotiating volume discounts, said a GetThere spokesman. Also, big companies tend to have higher online booking adoption rates because "they have more leverage with their employees," he added. That means big companies are more inclined, and better able, to require compliance with travel policies.Airline Traffic Remains Stalled"Traffic recovery in the airline industry has stalled," said David Swierenga, the chief economist of the Air Transport Association, the airline industry's trade group.He was referring to the recently released statistics for the industry's benchmark: revenue passenger miles, which were down 8.4 percent last month compared with July 2001.The domestic load factor -- the percent of seats filled by paying customers -- was 76.3 percent, meanwhile. That is a narrow increase over last July. But the number does not hold up so well when you consider that airlines flew 7.2 percent fewer seats this July. While domestic air travel remains in the doldrums, the picture is brightening overseas, according to OAG, the international airline and air-schedule guide. According to OAG, scheduled flights worldwide in August are down only 4 percent.Trans-Atlantic routes are showing steep declines, though. Flights from Kennedy International in New York to Western Europe are down 15 percent; from Los Angeles, they are down 21 percent, OAG said.JetBlue Airways Shuns Philadelphia"On the whole, I'd rather be in Philadelphia," W. C. Fields once said when asked what epitaph he wanted on his tombstone. Not so for JetBlue Airways, evidently. Is upstart JetBlue looking to expand into Philadelphia, where US Airways, which filed for bankruptcy protection last week, now controls most of the gates and about 75 percent of the departures? Gareth Edmondson-Jones, a JetBlue spokesman, said probably not. Big carriers who control large numbers of gates sometimes block low-fare competitors from major airports, but even if some US Air gates open up at Philadelphia International Airport, JetBlue is not immediately interested. "At heart, we're plane-constrained," Mr. Edmondson-Jones said. "We get about 15 new aircraft a year. We want to grow slowly and properly."Philadelphia just isn't that compelling, evidently. "After only 30 months of operation, we're still cherry-picking" expansion areas, he said.   JOE SHARKEYURL: http://www.nytimes.com LOAD-DATE: August 20, 2002  LANGUAGE: ENGLISH PUBLICATION-TYPE: NewspaperCopyright 2002 The New York Times Company
